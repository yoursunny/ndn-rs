# ndn-rs

A [Named Data Networking (NDN)](https://named-data.net/) forwarder stack written in Rust (edition 2024).

NDN is a content-centric networking architecture where packets are named data objects rather than addressed to endpoints. Consumers express **Interests** by name; the network routes them toward producers and returns **Data** along the reverse path, with in-network caching at every hop.

This stack takes a Rust-idiomatic approach: composable async pipelines with trait-based polymorphism rather than class hierarchies. It targets both standalone forwarder deployments and embedded use within research applications — the engine is a library, not a daemon.

## Status

Early development. The workspace skeleton and core data structures compile. Active design and implementation in progress.

## Features

- **Zero-copy packet handling** — `bytes::Bytes` slicing throughout; CS hits serve data directly from receive buffers
- **Composable pipeline stages** — `PipelineStage` trait with `PacketContext` passed by value; compiler-enforced short-circuit semantics
- **Pluggable forwarding strategies** — name-trie dispatch to `Arc<dyn Strategy>`; hot-swappable at runtime
- **Pluggable content store** — `ContentStore` trait with `NullCs`, `LruCs`, `ShardedCs`, `PersistentCs` (redb/RocksDB)
- **Link-layer NDN** — `NamedEtherFace` over `AF_PACKET` with NDN Ethertype `0x8624`; no IP dependency for local wireless
- **Multi-radio / multi-channel** — `RadioTable` + `MultiRadioStrategy` + nl80211 `ChannelManager`
- **wfb-ng support** — `WfbFace` + `FacePairTable` for asymmetric broadcast links (FPV / long-range)
- **Serial and Bluetooth** — `SerialFace` (COBS framing), Bluetooth Classic (RFCOMM), BLE (L2CAP CoC)
- **In-network compute** — `ComputeFace` + `ComputeRegistry` for named function execution with CS memoization
- **NDN as IPC** — `AppFace` with in-process `mpsc` or cross-process iceoryx2; service registry; push via standing Interests
- **Type-safe security** — `SafeData` newtype enforces verified status at compile time; trust schema with named capture groups
- **Structured tracing** — `tracing` spans per packet; OTLP export for distributed traces across forwarder hops

```

Dependency layers flow strictly downward: `ndn-tlv` and `ndn-packet` have no async dependency and can compile `no_std` for embedded sensor nodes.

## Quick Start

### Build and test

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

### Run the standalone forwarder

```bash
# Default config (no faces, no routes — useful to verify the engine starts):
cargo run --bin ndn-router

# With a config file:
cargo run --bin ndn-router -- -c ndn-router.toml

# Custom management socket path:
cargo run --bin ndn-router -- -c ndn-router.toml -m /run/ndn/mgmt.sock
```

The router logs to stderr in structured format. Set `RUST_LOG=debug` for
verbose output or `RUST_LOG=ndn_engine=trace` to trace individual pipeline
stages.

### Send management commands at runtime

The management server speaks newline-delimited JSON over a Unix socket.
Use `nc` (netcat) or any socket client:

```bash
SOCK=/tmp/ndn-router.sock

# Add a FIB route
echo '{"cmd":"add_route","prefix":"/ndn","face":0,"cost":10}' | nc -U $SOCK

# Remove a route
echo '{"cmd":"remove_route","prefix":"/ndn","face":0}' | nc -U $SOCK

# List registered face IDs
echo '{"cmd":"list_faces"}' | nc -U $SOCK

# Live engine stats (PIT size, etc.)
echo '{"cmd":"get_stats"}' | nc -U $SOCK

# Graceful shutdown
echo '{"cmd":"shutdown"}' | nc -U $SOCK
```

### Traffic generator and bandwidth measurement

Two tools measure full-pipeline performance by embedding a forwarding engine
with producer/consumer `AppFace` pairs:

```bash
# Traffic generator — configurable rate, concurrency, payload size:
cargo run --release --bin ndn-traffic -- --mode echo --count 100000 --concurrency 4

# Bandwidth measurement — sliding-window sustained throughput:
cargo run --release --bin ndn-iperf -- --duration 5 --size 8192 --window 64
```

See [`binaries/ndn-tools/README.md`](binaries/ndn-tools/README.md) for all
options and output format.

## Configuration

`ndn-router` is configured via a TOML file (`-c <path>`). All sections are
optional; omitting a section uses the defaults shown below.

### Full schema

```toml
# ── Engine ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[engine]
# Content store size in megabytes. Set to 0 to disable caching.
cs_capacity_mb = 64          # default: 64

# Backpressure bound on the face-to-pipeline channel.
pipeline_channel_cap = 1024  # default: 1024


# ── Faces ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Each [[face]] block defines one transport endpoint.
# Faces are assigned sequential IDs (0, 1, 2 …) in declaration order.

[[face]]
# Unicast UDP face — connected to one remote peer.
kind   = "udp"
bind   = "0.0.0.0:6363"      # local address:port
remote = "192.168.1.2:6363"  # peer address:port

[[face]]
# NDN multicast face — sends to and receives from all LAN neighbours.
kind      = "multicast"
group     = "224.0.23.170"   # NDN IPv4 multicast group (standard)
port      = 56363            # multicast port
interface = "eth0"           # outbound interface name

[[face]]
# TCP face — one connected stream.
kind   = "tcp"
bind   = "0.0.0.0:6363"
remote = "10.0.0.1:6363"

[[face]]
# Unix domain socket face — for local inter-process communication.
kind = "unix"
path = "/run/ndn/local.sock"


# ── Static FIB Routes ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Each [[route]] entry adds one nexthop to the FIB at startup.
# `face` is the zero-based index from the [[face]] list above.
# Multiple [[route]] entries may share the same prefix to create multipath.

[[route]]
prefix = "/ndn"     # NDN name prefix (slash-separated components)
face   = 0          # face index
cost   = 10         # routing cost; lower is preferred (default: 10)

[[route]]
prefix = "/local"
face   = 1


# ── Security ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[security]
# Path to the trust-anchor certificate file (PEM or NDN wire format).
trust_anchor = "/etc/ndn/trust-anchor.cert"  # optional

# Directory containing key files for this node.
key_dir = "/etc/ndn/keys"                    # optional

# When true, the engine drops any Data packet that cannot be verified against
# the trust schema. Requires trust_anchor to be set.
require_signed = false                       # default: false
```

### Example: two-node testbed

```toml
# Node A — ndn-router.toml
[engine]
cs_capacity_mb = 128

[[face]]
kind   = "udp"
bind   = "0.0.0.0:6363"
remote = "192.168.1.2:6363"   # Node B

[[route]]
prefix = "/ndn/nodeB"
face   = 0
cost   = 10

[security]
trust_anchor = "testbed-anchor.cert"
```

```toml
# Node B — ndn-router.toml
[engine]
cs_capacity_mb = 128

[[face]]
kind   = "udp"
bind   = "0.0.0.0:6363"
remote = "192.168.1.1:6363"   # Node A

[[route]]
prefix = "/ndn/nodeA"
face   = 0
cost   = 10
```

### Example: LAN multicast + local app

```toml
[[face]]
kind      = "multicast"
group     = "224.0.23.170"
port      = 56363
interface = "eth0"

[[face]]
kind = "unix"
path = "/run/ndn/app.sock"

[[route]]
prefix = "/"      # default route — forward everything to LAN neighbours
face   = 0
cost   = 100

[[route]]
prefix = "/local" # local prefix served by the application on face 1
face   = 1
cost   = 0
```

## Research Extensions

The `ndn-research` crate provides extension points for wireless and networking research:

- **`FlowObserverStage`** — non-blocking packet observation at pipeline entry/exit; feeds `mpsc` channel to external analysis tasks
- **`RadioTable`** — nl80211 link metrics per face (RSSI, MCS, channel utilization, retransmission rate)
- **`ChannelManager`** — reads nl80211 survey data, publishes as named NDN content, subscribes to neighbor state; handles channel switching with FIB/PIT consistency

The engine exposes `Arc` handles to all internal tables, so a research controller is just another Tokio task — no IPC boundary, microsecond observation-to-action latency.
