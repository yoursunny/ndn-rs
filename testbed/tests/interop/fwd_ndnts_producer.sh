# Interop: ndn-rs consumer ← ndn-fwd → NDNts producer.
#
# 1. NDNts ndncat registers /interop/ndnts-producer on ndn-fwd via Unix socket.
# 2. ndn-rs ndn-peek fetches it via the ndn-fwd Unix socket using segmented fetch
#    (CanBePrefix discovery → version component → seg=0).
#
# Route detection strategy:
#   (a) After the sleep, query the FIB (ndn-ctl route list).  If the prefix is
#       already there, NDNts self-registered — no manual step needed.
#   (b) If not, fall back to manual registration: enumerate ALL active connection
#       faces (faceid < 0xFFFF_0000, excluding the reserved management face) and
#       pick the lowest-numbered one.  NDNts connected before this query, so its
#       face has the smallest ID.
#
# This replaces the old PRE/POST face-list diff which was broken by face-ID
# recycling: ndn-ctl allocates a face, exits, and that ID is recycled to ndncat,
# so ndncat's face cancels out of the diff and the wrong (transient) face gets
# selected for manual route registration.
