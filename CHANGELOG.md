# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project does not yet follow Semantic Versioning — the codebase is in active
bootstrapping phase and all APIs should be considered unstable.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Gossip module: `EpidemicGossip` and `SvsServiceDiscovery` (`ndn-discovery/src/gossip/`)

Added `crates/ndn-discovery/src/gossip/`, a new module providing two
`DiscoveryProtocol` implementations for network-wide state dissemination:

**`EpidemicGossip`** (`gossip/epidemic.rs`) — pull-gossip for neighbor state:
- Claims `/ndn/local/nd/gossip/`
- Publishes a neighbor snapshot under `/ndn/local/nd/gossip/<node-name>/<seq>`
  every 5 s; payload is a sequence of `Name TLV`s for each Established or Stale
  neighbor (no face IDs — those are link-local and meaningless to remote nodes)
- Subscribes to established peers by expressing `CanBePrefix=true` Interests
  for `/ndn/local/nd/gossip/<peer-name>/`; respects the `gossip_fanout` config
  field to cap the number of subscriptions per tick
- On receiving a gossip Data: inserts unknown neighbor names as
  `NeighborState::Probing` entries so the normal hello state machine takes over
  confirmation

**`SvsServiceDiscovery`** (`gossip/svs_gossip.rs`) — SVS-backed push service
record notifications:
- Claims `/ndn/local/sd/updates/` (the SVS sync group for service records)
- Joins the group via `ndn_sync::join_svs_group` at construction time, spawning
  an async background task; bridge to synchronous `DiscoveryProtocol` hooks is
  via two `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels
- `on_inbound`: non-blocking `try_send` of incoming SVS Sync Interests into the
  background task's receive channel
- `on_tick`: drains both channels with `try_recv()` — forwards outgoing Sync
  Interests to all reachable neighbor faces; for each `SyncUpdate` gap expresses
  fetch Interests for the missing service record sequence numbers

**Supporting changes:**
- `scope.rs`: added `gossip_prefix()` → `/ndn/local/nd/gossip`
- `ndn-discovery/Cargo.toml`: added `ndn-sync` dependency
- `ndn-sync/Cargo.toml`: added `rt` and `macros` Tokio features (needed for
  `tokio::spawn` and `tokio::select!` in the SVS background task)
- `lib.rs`: exported `gossip` module, `EpidemicGossip`, `SvsServiceDiscovery`,
  `gossip_prefix`

#### `NeighborState` variant rename: `Reachable`→`Established`, `Failing`→`Stale`, `Dead`→`Absent`

Renamed the three non-`Probing` states to match the names used throughout
`docs/discovery.md` and the state-machine diagram:

- `Reachable { last_seen }` → `Established { last_seen }`
- `Failing { miss_count, last_seen }` → `Stale { miss_count, last_seen }`
- `Dead` → `Absent`

`NeighborEntry::is_reachable()` updated to match `Established`.

#### `DiscoveryProtocol::tick_interval()` — per-protocol tick cadence

Added a `tick_interval() -> Duration` method (default: 100 ms) to
`DiscoveryProtocol`.  The engine's discovery tick task now reads this at startup
and drives `on_tick` at the protocol's preferred cadence instead of a hardcoded
100 ms.  High-mobility profiles can use 20–50 ms; static deployments can use 1 s.

#### SWIM indirect probing and gossip in `UdpNeighborDiscovery`

Completed the SWIM state machine and gossip piggybacking in `UdpNeighborDiscovery`:

- **`handle_direct_probe_interest`** — responds to
  `/ndn/local/nd/probe/direct/<target>/<nonce>` with a probe-ack Data if this
  node is the target
- **`handle_via_probe_interest`** — responds to
  `/ndn/local/nd/probe/via/<intermediary>/<target>/<nonce>` by relaying a direct
  probe Interest on behalf of the requester; records the relay in `relay_probes`
- **`handle_probe_ack`** — disambiguates direct acks from relay acks by nonce;
  marks the probed neighbor `Established` or clears `Probing` entry on success
- **SWIM probe timeouts in `on_tick`** — on direct-probe timeout, dispatches K
  indirect probes via random established neighbors (K = `swim_indirect_fanout`)
- **SWIM diff `Add` entries → `NeighborState::Probing`** — previously SWIM diffs
  only triggered broadcasts; now unknown Add entries immediately create `Probing`
  state so the hello state machine confirms them
- **FreshnessPeriod fix** — hello Data `FreshnessPeriod` was hardcoded to 0;
  now set to `hello_interval_base × 2` (spec-required)
- **`relay_records` implemented** — when `ServiceDiscoveryConfig::relay_records`
  is true, incoming service record Data is forwarded to all other established
  peers (previously the field existed but had no effect)

#### SWIM indirect probing and gossip in `EtherNeighborDiscovery`

Brought `EtherNeighborDiscovery` (`ndn-face-l2`) to full feature parity with
`UdpNeighborDiscovery`:

- Added `swim_probes` and `relay_probes` hash maps for tracking outstanding
  direct and relay probe state
- Implemented `handle_direct_probe_interest`, `handle_via_probe_interest`,
  `handle_probe_ack` with the same logic as the UDP counterpart
- `on_tick` now schedules SWIM direct probes for stale neighbors and dispatches
  indirect probes on timeout, in addition to the K-gossip unicast sweep
- Probe prefixes added to `claimed` at construction when SWIM is enabled
- `FreshnessPeriod` and `InterestLifetime` corrected from hardcoded values to
  `hello_interval_base × 2`
- `tick_interval()` now returns `self.config.tick_interval`
- SWIM diff `Add` entries create `Probing` state (same fix as UDP)

#### Source address propagation: `Face::recv_with_addr()` and dispatcher wiring

Enabled the discovery layer to learn the UDP source address of inbound hello
packets without embedding addresses in NDN payloads:

- **`Face::recv_with_addr()`** — new default method on `Face` returning
  `(Bytes, Option<SocketAddr>)`; the base implementation returns `None`
- **`ErasedFace::recv_bytes_with_addr()`** — object-safe boxed-future version
  on the erased trait; blanket impl delegates to `Face::recv_with_addr`
- **`MulticastUdpFace`** — overrides `recv_with_addr()` to return the UDP source
  address alongside the packet bytes
- **Dispatcher** — `run_face_reader` now calls `recv_bytes_with_addr()` and
  passes `InboundMeta::udp(addr)` / `InboundMeta::none()` to `on_inbound`

#### Link-local scope enforcement in `StrategyStage`

`/ndn/local/` packets are now prevented from leaking onto non-local faces:

- In `ForwardingAction::Forward` handling, when the Interest name has prefix
  `/ndn/local/`, nexthops are filtered to faces whose `FaceKind::scope()`
  returns `FaceScope::Local`
- If all nexthops are filtered out, the pipeline returns `Nack(NoRoute)` instead
  of forwarding
- Mirrors IPv6 `fe80::/10` link-local address semantics

#### Auto-FIB TTL expiry in `ServiceDiscoveryProtocol`

Auto-populated FIB entries (from incoming service record Data) now expire:

- Each auto-populated entry is tracked with `expires_at = freshness_period ×
  auto_fib_ttl_multiplier` (config field, default 2.0)
- `on_tick` removes expired entries via `ctx.remove_fib_entry`

#### Single-peer query for `/ndn/local/nd/peers/<node-name>`

`ServiceDiscoveryProtocol` now handles single-peer Interest queries in addition
to the full peer-list query:

- Interest for `/ndn/local/nd/peers/<node-name>` responds with a single-entry
  peer list if the named neighbor is known; Nacks with `NoRoute` otherwise
- Existing full-list response for `/ndn/local/nd/peers` is unchanged

---

### Added

#### Spec-compliant NDN neighbor discovery hello format

Migrated `EtherNeighborDiscovery` and `UdpNeighborDiscovery` from a custom
hello format (sender name embedded in Interest name components + AppParams) to
the format specified in `docs/discovery.md`:

- **`HelloPayload` TLV** (`ndn-discovery/src/hello.rs`) — encodes/decodes the
  Data Content for hello replies:
  - `NODE-NAME` (0xC1): sender's NDN node name
  - `SERVED-PREFIX` (0xC2): prefixes the sender can serve (zero or more)
  - `CAPABILITIES` (0xC3): advisory flags — `CAP_FRAGMENTATION`, `CAP_CONTENT_STORE`,
    `CAP_VALIDATION`, `CAP_SVS`
  - `NEIGHBOR-DIFF` (0xC4): SWIM gossip piggyback (add/remove entries)
  - All types use the application-specific range (≥ 0xC0); unknown types are
    silently skipped for forward compatibility
- **Hello Interest name**: `/ndn/local/nd/hello/<nonce-u32>` (flat, no embedded
  sender name, no AppParams)
- **`InboundMeta`** (`ndn-discovery/src/protocol.rs`) — thin per-packet metadata
  struct passed to `DiscoveryProtocol::on_inbound`; carries `source: Option<LinkAddr>`
  (either `LinkAddr::Ether(MacAddr)` or `LinkAddr::Udp(SocketAddr)`) so protocols
  can learn the sender's link-layer address without embedding it in the NDN packet
- **`MulticastUdpFace::recv_with_source()`** — returns `(Bytes, SocketAddr)`;
  `Face::recv()` now delegates to it, eliminating code duplication
- **`UdpNeighborDiscovery`** constructor simplified from 3 args to 2 — no longer
  needs to know its own UDP address (sender learns responder address from `meta.source`)
- **`DiscoveryContext::alloc_face_id()`** — allocates a unique `FaceId` before
  constructing a face object that requires an ID at construction time

#### Renamed `ndn-face-wireless` → `ndn-face-l2`

Renamed the link-layer face crate from `ndn-face-wireless` to `ndn-face-l2` to
better reflect its scope (all L2 / raw Ethernet faces, not just wireless ones).

#### macOS raw Ethernet via `PF_NDRV` (`ndn-face-l2/src/ndrv.rs`)

Added `NdrvSocket` — an async-capable `PF_NDRV` socket for macOS that
provides the same send/receive API as the Linux `AF_PACKET` implementation:

- `NdrvSocket::new(iface)` — opens `socket(PF_NDRV=27, SOCK_RAW, 0)`, binds to
  the interface, registers EtherType 0x8624 via `NDRV_SETDMXSPEC`, joins the NDN
  multicast group (`01:00:5e:00:17:aa`) via `NDRV_ADDMULTICAST`
- `recv()` — strips 14-byte Ethernet header; returns `(payload, src_mac)` where
  source MAC is extracted from frame bytes `[6..12]`
- `send_to(payload, dst_mac)` / `send_to_mcast(payload)` — prepends the full
  Ethernet header before injecting the frame
- `get_iface_mac(iface)` — looks up the interface's MAC via `getifaddrs(3)`
- `NamedEtherFace` and `MulticastEtherFace` for macOS (`ndn-face-l2/src/ether_macos.rs`)
  wrap `NdrvSocket` and implement `Face`; `NamedEtherFace::recv` filters in
  software by source MAC

#### Windows raw Ethernet via Npcap (`ndn-face-l2/src/pcap_face.rs`)

Added `PcapSocket` — a Tokio-compatible Npcap socket for Windows:

- Two background OS threads bridge the blocking `pcap` API to Tokio `mpsc`
  channels: a **recv thread** (BPF filter `"ether proto 0x8624"`) and a **send
  thread** (`sendpacket`)
- `recv(&self)` uses `Mutex<mpsc::Receiver>` so it satisfies the `Face` trait's
  `&self` requirement
- **`get_iface_mac(iface)`** — fully implemented via `GetAdaptersAddresses`
  (`iphlpapi.dll` / `windows-sys`); accepts either the Npcap GUID device name
  (`\Device\NPF_{...}`) or the adapter's friendly name (e.g. `"Ethernet"`)
- `PcapSocket::new(iface)` auto-detects the local MAC; `new_with_mac(iface, mac)`
  is available for virtual interfaces
- `NamedEtherFace` and `MulticastEtherFace` for Windows (`ndn-face-l2/src/ether_windows.rs`)
  have the same constructor signatures as Linux and macOS
- Added `pcap = "2"` and `windows-sys = "0.61"` workspace dependencies

#### Discovery integration in `ndn-engine`

Wired `DiscoveryProtocol` fully into the forwarding engine:

- **`EngineBuilder::discovery(d)`** — attach any `DiscoveryProtocol` impl;
  defaults to `NoDiscovery` (static-route operation unchanged)
- **`ForwarderEngine::neighbors()`** — access the engine-owned `NeighborTable`
- **`ForwarderEngine::discovery_ctx()`** — access the `EngineDiscoveryContext`
  for direct manipulation from management code
- **`EngineDiscoveryContext`** — engine-side `DiscoveryContext` implementation:
  - `add_face` / `remove_face` — spawn/cancel face tasks dynamically
  - `add_fib_entry` / `remove_fib_entry` / `remove_fib_entries_by_owner` —
    ProtocolId-tagged FIB management (side-table tracks ownership)
  - `neighbors()` / `update_neighbor()` — engine-owned `NeighborTable` access
  - `send_on` — bypass pipeline and enqueue directly to a face's outbound queue
- **`on_face_up` / `on_face_down` hooks** — called on every face lifecycle event
  (add, send error cleanup, idle timeout sweep)
- **`on_inbound` intercept** — called in `run_face_reader` before packets enter
  the NDN forwarding pipeline; discovery packets (hellos, probes) are consumed
  without forwarding
- **Discovery tick task** — `on_tick` called every 100 ms for hello/probe scheduling
- `pipeline_tx` and `discovery_ctx` in `EngineInner` use `OnceLock` to enable
  safe construction ordering without unsafe code

#### Source MAC extraction in `ndn-face-l2`

`MulticastEtherFace::recv_with_source() -> (Bytes, MacAddr)` extracts the
sender's Ethernet address from the TPACKET_V2 `sockaddr_ll` embedded in each
ring frame — no extra syscall needed.  Used by link-layer neighbor discovery
to identify peers and create unicast faces.

#### `ndn-python` — PyO3 Python bindings (`bindings/ndn-python`)

Added `bindings/ndn-python`, a PyO3-based Python extension module exposing
the NDN application API to Python. Built with `maturin`; no async runtime or
`asyncio` required on the Python side.

**`Consumer(socket: str)`** — connects to a running `ndn-router` over its Unix
socket and exposes two fetch methods:
- `get(name) -> bytes` — fetch content bytes (most common use case)
- `fetch(name) -> Data` — fetch the full `Data` object with `.name` and
  `.content` attributes

**`Producer(socket: str, prefix: str)`** — registers a prefix and serves
Interests via a Python callback:
- `serve(handler: (str) -> bytes | None)` — blocks until the connection
  closes; the GIL is released between Interest arrivals so other Python
  threads can run; re-acquired only during the callback invocation

**`Data`** — returned by `Consumer.fetch()`; `.name: str` and `.content: bytes`

Errors are raised as `RuntimeError`. Python 3.9+ required.

```bash
# Build and install (requires maturin):
cd bindings/ndn-python
maturin develop          # editable install
maturin build --release  # produce a wheel
```

```python
from ndn_rs import Consumer, Producer

c = Consumer("/tmp/ndn-faces.sock")
raw = c.get("/ndn/sensor/temperature")   # bytes

p = Producer("/tmp/ndn-faces.sock", "/ndn/sensor")
p.serve(lambda name: b"23.5" if "temperature" in name else None)
```

**Implementation notes:**
- Wraps `ndn-app`'s `blocking` feature (internal Tokio runtime, no `async`
  leaks through the Python boundary).
- `Producer::serve` wraps the Python handler in `Arc<Mutex<PyObject>>` to
  satisfy `BlockingProducer::serve`'s `F: Fn(..) + Send + Sync + 'static`
  bound; `py.allow_threads` releases the GIL for the wait loop.
- The `extension-module` feature is not in `default` so `cargo check -p
  ndn-python` works without Python installed.

#### `ndn-embedded` ergonomic API improvements

Added string-based convenience helpers to eliminate the boilerplate of manual
FNV-1a hash computation and component splitting:

**`Fib::add_route(prefix: &str, nexthop: FaceId)`** — parses a slash-delimited
NDN name string (e.g. `"/ndn/sensor"`) and calls through to `Fib::add`. Uses a
stack-allocated `heapless::Vec<&[u8], 16>` — no heap allocation.

**`wire::encode_interest_name(buf, name, nonce, lifetime_ms, ...)`** and
**`wire::encode_data_name(buf, name, content)`** — accept a `&str` name and
delegate to the existing component-slice encoders.

**`FnClock`** is now re-exported at the crate root alongside `NoOpClock`.

Before:
```rust
use ndn_embedded::fib::prefix_hash;
fib.add(FibEntry { prefix_hash: prefix_hash(&[b"ndn"]), prefix_len: 1, nexthop: 1, cost: 0 });
encode_interest(&mut buf, &[b"ndn", b"sensor", b"temp"], 42, 4000, false, false);
```

After:
```rust
fib.add_route("/ndn/sensor", 1);
wire::encode_interest_name(&mut buf, "/ndn/sensor/temp", 42, 4000, false, false);
```

### Added

#### `ndn-embedded` — bare-metal NDN forwarder crate (`no_std`)

Added `crates/ndn-embedded`, a `#![no_std]` NDN forwarder for ARM Cortex-M,
RISC-V, ESP32, and similar bare-metal MCUs. Inspired by zenoh-pico: a minimal
embedded implementation that shares only the TLV codec with the full std stack.
No heap allocator is required for the core forwarder.

**Architecture** — all state is const-generic and stack-allocated:
- `Pit<const N: usize>` — pending Interest table using `heapless::Vec`,
  keyed by FNV-1a name hash; supports nonce loop detection and per-entry
  lifetime expiry driven by a caller-supplied `Clock`.
- `Fib<const N: usize>` — forwarding information base with longest-prefix
  match over FNV-1a prefix hashes; O(N) lookup, zero alloc.
- `Forwarder<P, F, C: Clock>` — single-threaded packet dispatcher:
  `process_packet()` handles Interest (FIB lookup, PIT insert, split-horizon),
  Data (PIT satisfaction), and unwrapped NDNLPv2 fragments; `run_one_tick()`
  purges expired PIT entries.
- `ContentStore<N, MAX_LEN>` — round-robin eviction cache, behind `cs` feature.
- COBS framing (`cobs.rs`) — encode/decode over `&[u8]` slices; 0x00 = frame
  delimiter, algorithm-compatible with `ndn-face-serial`.
- Slice-based TLV encoder (`wire.rs`) — `encode_interest()` / `encode_data()`
  write into caller-supplied `&mut [u8]` with no heap; correct minimal NDN
  varint encoding throughout.
- `Face` / `ErasedFace` traits using `nb::Result` (non-blocking, sync);
  integrates with `embedded-hal` and Embassy adapter pattern.
- SPSC app↔forwarder channel (`ipc.rs`) via `heapless::spsc::Queue`, behind
  `ipc` feature.

**Feature flags:**
```toml
ndn-embedded = { path = "...", features = [] }       # heapless only, no alloc
ndn-embedded = { path = "...", features = ["alloc"] } # hashbrown available
ndn-embedded = { path = "...", features = ["cs"] }    # content store enabled
ndn-embedded = { path = "...", features = ["ipc"] }   # app queues enabled
```

**CI:** `.github/workflows/embedded.yml` cross-compiles to
`thumbv7em-none-eabihf` for all three no-std check variants, plus runs the
29-test host suite and the 32-test `--features cs` suite on every push/PR.

#### `ndn-tlv` / `ndn-packet` no-std support

Fixed lingering `std`-only leakage in the two foundation crates so that
`ndn-embedded` can use them without a heap allocator:

- **`ndn-tlv`**: `std` feature now activates `bytes/std`; `writer.rs` imports
  `alloc::vec::Vec` under `#[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]`.
- **`ndn-packet`**: `encode` and `fragment` modules gated behind
  `#[cfg(feature = "std")]`; `Arc` / `OnceLock` imports conditionalized to
  `alloc::sync::Arc` / `core::cell::OnceCell` in no-std mode; `ring` digest
  verification gated behind `std` (crypto primitives require `std`); `lp.rs`
  carries a local `nni()` helper so it no longer depends on `encode`.
- **Workspace**: `bytes` and `ndn-tlv` workspace dependencies now declare
  `default-features = false`; all std crates opt-in with
  `features = ["std"]` at their declaration site.

### Removed

#### iceoryx2 references

Removed all references to the `iceoryx2-mgmt` feature and iceoryx shared-memory
transport from non-documentation source files. The feature was never implemented;
`ndn-router/src/main.rs` cfg guards and `ndn-config` doc comments have been
updated accordingly.

### Added

#### Criterion benchmarks for security, name operations, content store, and pipeline

Added four new Criterion benchmark suites covering previously un-benchmarked hot
paths, plus correctness fixes and new variants for the existing pipeline bench.

**`crates/ndn-security/benches/security.rs`**
- `signing/ed25519` and `signing/hmac` — `sign_sync()` at 100 B and 500 B
  regions with `Throughput::Bytes`; isolates pure crypto cost and shows
  ~10× HMAC-over-Ed25519 throughput advantage.
- `verification/ed25519` — region pre-signed outside `b.iter()`; benchmarks
  only the verify call, revealing the asymmetry between sign and verify.
- `validation/schema_mismatch` — empty schema rejects packet before any
  crypto; fast path baseline.
- `validation/cert_missing` — `accept_all` schema passes but cert absent
  from cache; returns `Pending` without crypto.
- `validation/single_hop` — full path: schema check + cert cache lookup +
  Ed25519 verify via `Validator::validate`.

**`crates/ndn-packet/benches/name.rs`**
- `name/parse` — `Name::from_str` at 4, 8, 12 components with `Throughput::Elements(1)`.
- `name/tlv_decode` — `Name::decode(wire)` from pre-encoded TLV bytes.
- `name/hash` — `DefaultHasher::hash(&name)` at 4 and 8 components; critical
  for DashMap shard selection in the PIT.
- `name/eq` — three variants: `eq_match`, `eq_miss_first` (short-circuits
  immediately), `eq_miss_last` (scans all components).
- `name/has_prefix` — prefix lengths 1, 4, 8 on an 8-component name;
  shows per-depth cost for FIB trie descent.
- `name/display` — `name.to_string()` at 4 and 8 components; tracing span
  overhead measurement.

**`crates/ndn-store/benches/content_store.rs`** (requires `--features fjall`)
- `lru/get_hit`, `lru/get_miss_empty` (atomic fast path), `lru/get_miss_populated`,
  `lru/get_can_be_prefix` (NameTrie path), `lru/insert_replace`,
  `lru/insert_new` (unique names via counter), `lru/evict`, `lru/evict_prefix`
  (100 entries, NameTrie descendants walk).
- `sharded/get_hit` and `sharded/insert` at shard counts 1, 4, 8, 16 —
  shows lock contention reduction vs. sharding overhead.
- `fjall/get_hit`, `fjall/get_miss`, `fjall/insert` — absolute cost
  reference for the persistent CS against in-memory alternatives.

**`crates/ndn-engine/benches/pipeline.rs`** (updated)
- **Fixed `cs_insert` correctness** — split the single `insert` bench into
  two named variants:
  - `insert_replace` — same name every iteration (what the original bench
    always measured — `Replaced` after warm-up, not `Inserted`).
  - `insert_new` — unique names via `AtomicU64` counter; measures fresh
    insert + NameTrie update + potential LRU eviction.
- **Added `validation_stage` group** — two new variants:
  - `disabled` — `ValidationStage::disabled()`; packet passes immediately,
    establishes baseline overhead.
  - `cert_via_anchor` — validator with `accept_all` schema and a trust anchor
    registered; exercises schema check + trust anchor lookup + Ed25519 verify
    via `validate_chain`.
- Added `ndn-security` to `ndn-engine` dev-dependencies.

Run benchmarks:
```bash
cargo bench -p ndn-security
cargo bench -p ndn-packet
cargo bench -p ndn-store --features fjall
cargo bench -p ndn-engine
```

#### `FjallCs` — persistent content store backed by fjall LSM-tree

Added `FjallCs` in `ndn-store` as the first disk-backed `ContentStore`
implementation. Data survives process restarts; entries are recovered on
reopen by a single forward scan.

- **Key layout:** concatenated NDN TLV-encoded name components — no outer
  `0x07` Name wrapper — preserving lexicographic order so that `CanBePrefix`
  lookups become native fjall range/prefix scans.
- **Value layout:** `[stale_at: 8 B big-endian u64][wire Data bytes]` — zero
  extra allocation on insert, direct slice on read.
- **Capacity eviction:** evicts the lexicographically smallest entries when
  the configured byte budget is exceeded (key-order scan, not LRU — disk
  stores have no meaningful access-order signal).
- Fully implements `ContentStore`: exact match, `CanBePrefix` prefix scan,
  `MustBeFresh` freshness filter, implicit SHA-256 digest verification,
  `evict`, `evict_prefix` with optional limit, `set_capacity` with
  immediate excess eviction, `len`, `current_bytes`, `variant_name`.
- **Feature-gated** — `ndn-store/fjall` Cargo feature; zero extra
  dependencies unless opted in.  Tests always enable it via `dev-dependencies`.
- Added `fjall = "3"` to the workspace dependency table.
- 22 new tests covering all operations including a `data_survives_reopen`
  round-trip test.

#### `InterestBuilder` forwarding hint and signed Interest support

Extended `InterestBuilder` in `ndn-packet` with two new capabilities:

- **Forwarding hint** — `InterestBuilder::forwarding_hint(names: Vec<Name>)`
  writes a `ForwardingHint` TLV containing one or more Name delegates.
- **`build()` rewrite** — inlines the `ParametersSha256DigestComponent`
  computation directly into the Interest TLV so the full packet (including
  forwarding hint, hop limit, and application parameters) is written in one
  pass.  Previously `build()` delegated to `encode_interest()` when app
  parameters were present, losing forwarding hint and other fields.
- **Signed Interest (NDN v0.3 §5.4)** — two new methods on `InterestBuilder`:
  - `sign_sync(sig_type, key_locator, sign_fn) -> Bytes` — synchronous path
    for CPU-only signers (Ed25519, HMAC).
  - `sign(sig_type, key_locator, sign_fn) -> impl Future<Output = Bytes>` —
    async path for HSM or remote signers.
  Both methods build the signed region (Name through
  `InterestSignatureInfo`), call the caller-supplied signer, then append
  `InterestSignatureValue`.  Anti-replay fields (`SignatureNonce`,
  `SignatureTime`) are auto-generated if none were set on the builder.
- 8 new tests: forwarding hint roundtrip, signed Interest roundtrip,
  auto-anti-replay, empty-params default, signed-region bounds, async/sync
  structural equivalence, and full combined options test.

#### `LoggingConfig` section in `ForwarderConfig`

Added `[logging]` to `ndn-config`'s `ForwarderConfig`:

```toml
[logging]
level = "info"                    # default; overridden by --log-level or RUST_LOG
file  = "/var/log/ndn/router.log" # optional; enables dual stderr+file output
```

- `LoggingConfig` struct with `level: String` (default `"info"`) and
  `file: Option<String>`.
- `LoggingConfig` is re-exported from `ndn-config`.

#### Structured CLI arguments and configurable tracing in `ndn-router`

Replaced the router's ad-hoc argument parsing with a `CliArgs` struct and a
dedicated `init_tracing()` function:

- **`CliArgs` struct** — `config_path: Option<PathBuf>` and
  `log_level: Option<String>`.  New `--log-level` flag sets the tracing
  filter without modifying `RUST_LOG`.
- **Precedence** (highest wins): `RUST_LOG` env var → `--log-level` flag →
  `[logging] level` in config file.
- **Dual output** — when `[logging] file` is set, logs are written to both
  stderr and the file.  The file appender is non-blocking
  (`tracing-appender`) so log writes never stall the forwarding pipeline.
  `init_tracing()` returns an `Option<WorkerGuard>` that must be held until
  shutdown.
- Config is now loaded *before* tracing initialisation so the `[logging]`
  section is available when setting up the subscriber.
- Added `tracing-appender = "0.2"` to `ndn-router` dependencies.

### Changed

#### Unified `FaceKind` enum with `Display`, `FromStr`, and serde support

Eliminated the duplicate `FaceKind` enum that existed in both
`ndn-transport` (14 variants) and `ndn-config` (7 variants).  The
canonical enum now lives solely in `ndn-transport` with optional serde
support behind a `serde` feature flag.

- **`Display` + `FromStr`** for `FaceKind` — kebab-case string
  representations (`"udp"`, `"tcp"`, `"ether-multicast"`, etc.).
  Removes the `format!("{kind:?}").to_lowercase()` hack in the router.
- **`EtherMulticast` variant** added — `MulticastEtherFace` now returns
  its own distinct kind instead of sharing `Multicast` with UDP.
- **Serde support** — `#[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]` with
  `Serialize`/`Deserialize` behind `feature = "serde"`.
- **Deleted** `ndn_config::FaceKind` — replaced with
  `pub use ndn_transport::FaceKind`.

#### `FaceConfig` converted to serde tagged enum

Replaced the flat `FaceConfig` struct (9 `Option` fields, most
irrelevant per face type) with a `#[serde(tag = "kind")]` enum.
Invalid field combinations are now unrepresentable at parse time.
TOML surface syntax is unchanged.

```rust
#[serde(tag = "kind", rename_all = "kebab-case")]
pub enum FaceConfig {
    Udp { bind: Option<String>, remote: Option<String> },
    Tcp { bind: Option<String>, remote: Option<String> },
    Multicast { group: String, port: u16, interface: Option<String> },
    Unix { path: Option<String> },
    WebSocket { bind: Option<String>, url: Option<String> },
    Serial { path: String, baud: u32 },
    EtherMulticast { interface: String },
}
```

- Router match arms simplified — fields extracted directly from
  variants, no more `unwrap_or` chains for required fields.

#### `StreamFace<R, W, C>` generic eliminates stream face duplication

Extracted the shared `Mutex<FramedRead>` + `Mutex<FramedWrite>` pattern
into a single generic `StreamFace` in `ndn-transport`.  TCP, Unix, and
Serial faces become type aliases with thin constructor functions.

- **`StreamFace::new(id, kind, lp_encode, ...)`** — single constructor
  taking read/write halves and a codec.  The `lp_encode` flag explicitly
  controls whether `send()` wraps packets in NDNLPv2 framing.
- **`TcpFace`** = `StreamFace<OwnedReadHalf, OwnedWriteHalf, TlvCodec>`
- **`UnixFace`** = `StreamFace<OwnedReadHalf, OwnedWriteHalf, TlvCodec>`
- **`SerialFace`** = `StreamFace<ReadHalf<SerialStream>, WriteHalf<SerialStream>, CobsCodec>`
- Constructors: `tcp_face_from_stream()`, `tcp_face_connect()`,
  `unix_face_from_stream()`, `unix_face_connect()`, `serial_face_open()`.
- `TlvCodec` gains `Clone + Copy`, `CobsCodec` gains `Clone`.
- Removed `futures` dependency from `ndn-face-local` and
  `ndn-face-serial` (now only needed in `ndn-transport`).

#### LP encoding convention documented on `Face::send()`

Added doc comment to `Face::send()` explaining the convention: network
transports LP-encode, local transports don't.  References
`StreamFace::lp_encode` and `FaceKind::scope()`.

#### Router face startup consolidated

Extracted `parse_bind_addr()` helper for the repeated address parsing
pattern across UDP, TCP, and WebSocket match arms.

#### `BluetoothFace` stub cleaned up

Removed the placeholder `Face` impl (always returned `FaceError::Closed`).
Struct retained with TODO noting it should use `StreamFace<..., CobsCodec>`
when a Tokio-compatible RFCOMM crate is available.

### Added

#### Security pipeline: certificate fetching, chain validation, engine integration

Full NDN trust chain validation pipeline, from certificate fetching through
chain walking to engine-level Data packet verification.

- **`CertFetcher`** (`ndn-security`) — async certificate fetcher with
  deduplication via `DashMap` + `broadcast` channels. Concurrent requests
  for the same cert share a single Interest. Configurable timeout.
- **`Certificate` enhanced** — `decode()` now extracts `issuer` (from
  KeyLocator), `signed_region`, and `sig_value` from the Data packet,
  enabling chain-walking verification without re-parsing.
- **`Validator::validate_chain()`** — walks the certificate chain from
  Data → cert → ... → trust anchor. Cycle detection via `HashSet`,
  configurable depth limit (`max_chain`). Fetches missing certs via
  `CertFetcher` when configured.
- **`Validator::with_chain()`** constructor — accepts shared `CertCache`,
  trust anchors (`DashMap`), optional `CertFetcher`, and chain depth limit.
- **`Validator::add_trust_anchor()`** / `is_trust_anchor()` — manage
  trust anchors at runtime.
- **`ValidationStage`** (`ndn-engine`) — sits between PitMatch and
  CsInsert in the data pipeline. Drops Data packets that fail validation
  (`DropReason::ValidationFailed`). No-op when no validator is configured.
- **`EngineBuilder::validator()`** — opt-in: pass an `Arc<Validator>` to
  enable data pipeline validation.
- **`TrustError::ChainCycle`** variant for cycle detection.
- **`ValidationResult` is now `Debug`**, `SafeData` is now `Debug`.

#### Default-on security with opt-out model

Security is now enabled by default with sensible defaults and quality-of-life
bootstrapping. The design follows NDN's security-by-default philosophy.

- **`SecurityProfile`** enum (`ndn-security`) — configures engine validation:
  `Default` (full chain validation with hierarchical trust), `AcceptSigned`
  (verify signatures, skip chain walking), `Disabled` (benchmarking only),
  `Custom(Arc<Validator>)`. Engine auto-wires validator + cert fetcher from
  `SecurityManager` when profile is `Default`.
- **`TrustSchema::hierarchical()`** — default trust schema requiring data
  and key to share the first name component. `TrustSchema::accept_all()` for
  testing.
- **Pending validation queue** (`ValidationStage`) — bounded queue (256
  entries, 4 MB) for Data packets awaiting certificate fetching. Background
  drain task re-validates at 100 ms intervals. Packets that time out (4 s)
  are dropped with `DropReason::ValidationTimeout`.
- **`SecurityManager::auto_init()`** — first-run bootstrapping: generates
  Ed25519 identity + self-signed certificate in the PIB if no keys exist.
  Returns `(SecurityManager, bool)` indicating whether generation occurred.
- **`[security]` config** — new `auto_init` (bool) and `profile` (string)
  fields. `auto_init = true` generates identity on first startup.
  `profile = "default" | "accept-signed" | "disabled"`.
- **`ndn-ctl security`** subcommands — local PIB management without a
  running router: `init` (generate identity), `trust` (add trust anchor
  from .ndnc file), `export` (export certificate), `info` (list keys and
  anchors).

#### SerialFace with COBS framing

Full serial port face implementation replacing the previous stub.  COBS
(Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing) encodes packets so `0x00` never
appears in the payload, making `0x00` a reliable frame delimiter for
resync after line noise.

- **`CobsCodec`** — `tokio_util::codec::{Encoder, Decoder}` for COBS
  framing.  Max overhead ~0.4% (1 byte per 254 input bytes).
- **`SerialFace::open(id, port, baud)`** — opens a serial port via
  `tokio-serial`, splits into `FramedRead`/`FramedWrite` with `CobsCodec`.
  Mirrors the `TcpFace` `Mutex<FramedRead>` + `Mutex<FramedWrite>` pattern.
- Suitable for: UART sensor nodes, LoRa radio modems, RS-485 buses.
- Gated behind the `serial` feature (default on) in `ndn-face-serial`.

#### Multicast Ethernet face (`MulticastEtherFace`)

L2 multicast neighbor discovery face, the Ethernet equivalent of
`MulticastUdpFace`.  Joins the IANA NDN Ethernet multicast group
(`01:00:5e:00:17:aa`) and uses the same TPACKET_V2 zero-copy ring
buffers as `NamedEtherFace`.

- **`MulticastEtherFace::new(id, iface)`** — opens AF_PACKET socket,
  joins multicast group via `PACKET_ADD_MEMBERSHIP`, sets up mmap ring.
- NDNLPv2 fragmentation for packets exceeding Ethernet MTU (1500 B).
- **Refactored `af_packet` module** — extracted shared AF_PACKET
  infrastructure (MacAddr, socket helpers, TPACKET_V2 PacketRing) from
  `ether.rs` into `af_packet.rs` for reuse by both unicast and multicast
  faces.
- Linux only (`#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`), requires `CAP_NET_RAW`.

#### WebSocket face (`WebSocketFace`)

NDN-over-WebSocket using binary frames, compatible with NFD's WebSocket
transport.  WebSocket provides its own message framing so no `TlvCodec`
is needed — each binary message carries one NDNLPv2 packet.

- **`WebSocketFace::connect(id, url)`** — client-side via
  `tokio-tungstenite::connect_async`.
- **`WebSocketFace::from_stream(id, ws, remote, local)`** — server-side,
  wraps an accepted WebSocket connection.
- **`FaceKind::WebSocket`** added to transport layer (scope: `NonLocal`).
- Gated behind the `websocket` feature (default on) in `ndn-face-net`.
- Uses `tokio-tungstenite` with native-tls for wss:// support.

#### Config and router integration for new face types

- **`FaceKind` config variants** — `web-socket`, `ether-multicast`,
  `serial` added to the TOML config enum (kebab-case).
- **`FaceConfig` fields** — `baud` (serial baud rate), `url` (WebSocket
  client URL).  Existing `path` field used for serial port path,
  `interface` for ether-multicast, `bind` for WebSocket listener.
- **Router match arms** — `ndn-router` creates faces from config for all
  three new types.  WebSocket gets a `run_ws_listener` accept loop
  mirroring the TCP listener.  Serial and ether-multicast create faces
  directly.
- Router features: `websocket` and `serial` (both default on).

#### Configurable per-face reliability (`ReliabilityConfig`, `RtoStrategy`)

All NDNLPv2 reliability knobs are now runtime-tunable per face via a
`ReliabilityConfig` struct with presets for common link types.

- **`ReliabilityConfig`** — bundles `max_retries`, `max_unacked`,
  `max_retx_per_tick`, and `rto_strategy` into a single config struct.
  Presets: `default()` (RFC 6298), `local()`, `ethernet()`, `wifi()`.
- **`RtoStrategy` enum** — switchable RTO algorithm per face:
  - `Rfc6298` — EWMA with 200ms floor, 1s initial (default).
  - `Quic` — RFC 9002-style, 333ms initial, no floor.
  - `MinRtt` — minimum observed RTT + configurable margin.
  - `Fixed` — constant RTO for known-latency links (Unix, SHM).
- **`LpReliability::from_config(mtu, config)`** — construct from config.
- **`LpReliability::apply_config(config)`** — reconfigure at runtime.

#### Consumer-side congestion control (`CongestionController`)

New `ndn_transport::CongestionController` enum with three algorithms for
regulating how many Interests a consumer keeps in flight.

- **AIMD** — additive-increase multiplicative-decrease, matches
  `ndncatchunks` behavior.  Slow-start then linear growth, ×0.5 on loss.
- **CUBIC** — RFC 8312 cubic function ramp-up, ×0.7 decrease.  Better
  for high-bandwidth, long-RTT links.
- **Fixed** — constant window, no adaptation (for benchmarks).
- All algorithms support slow-start, min/max window bounds, and `reset()`.
- Builder-style parameter tuning: `with_max_window()`,
  `with_additive_increase()`, `with_decrease_factor()`, `with_cubic_c()`.

#### ndn-iperf adaptive congestion control

The iperf client now uses `CongestionController` instead of a fixed
sliding window, with full CLI configurability.

- **`--cc <algorithm>`** — select `aimd` (default), `cubic`, or `fixed`.
- **`--ai`** — AIMD additive increase per RTT.
- **`--md`** — multiplicative decrease factor.
- **`--cubic-c`** — CUBIC scaling constant.
- **`--min-window`** / **`--max-window`** — window bounds.
- Window now grows on successful Data and shrinks on timeout/congestion.

#### Sync protocol network layer and pub/sub API

Integrated sync and query primitives into the application API, inspired by
Zenoh's pub/sub/queryable model but built on NDN's Interest/Data machinery.

- **`ndn-sync` network layer** — `join_svs_group()` runs SVS as a background
  task: periodic Sync Interests with state vector encoding, gap detection,
  and `SyncUpdate` notifications.  `SyncHandle` provides `recv()` for updates
  and `publish()` to announce local data.  Configurable via `SvsConfig`
  (interval, jitter, channel capacity).
- **`Subscriber`** (`ndn-app`) — high-level subscription API.
  `Subscriber::connect(socket, "/chat/room1")` joins an SVS group and
  returns a stream of `Sample`s (name, publisher, seq, optional payload).
- **`Queryable`** (`ndn-app`) — register a prefix and serve queries via
  `queryable.serve(|interest| { ... })`.  Cleaner alternative to `Producer`
  for request/response patterns.
- **`SyncProtocol` abstraction** — `SyncHandle`, `SyncUpdate`, `SyncError`
  types in `ndn-sync::protocol` for future protocol backends (PSync network
  layer planned).
- Added to `ndn-app` prelude: `Subscriber`, `Queryable`.

#### Completed sync/query integration

- **`AppHandle` now supports `&self` for `recv()`** — the receiver is wrapped
  in a `Mutex`, enabling shared ownership and concurrent send/recv from
  different tasks.  `NdnConnection::recv()` likewise takes `&self`.
- **`Queryable::recv()`** — returns `Query` objects that carry the incoming
  Interest plus an `Arc<NdnConnection>` sender, so the application can reply
  from any task via `query.reply(data)`.
- **Subscriber auto-fetch** — when `auto_fetch` is enabled (default), the
  subscriber expresses Interests for each `SyncUpdate` and populates
  `Sample.payload` with the fetched Data content.  Configurable
  `fetch_timeout` (default 4s).
- **Subscriber recv pump** — incoming packets from the network connection
  are forwarded to the SVS task, closing the gap that previously required
  the caller to manually feed sync packets.
- **PSync network layer** (`ndn-sync::psync_sync`) — `join_psync_group()`
  runs PSync as a background task: periodic Sync Interests carrying IBF
  encoding, peer IBF subtraction and difference decoding, Data replies with
  missing hash sets.  Configurable via `PSyncConfig` (interval, jitter,
  IBF size).  `Ibf::from_cells()` / `Ibf::cells()` added for wire encoding.

#### Strategy dynamics: cross-layer context enrichment

Strategies can now access radio, link quality, location, and arbitrary
cross-layer data without coupling `ndn-strategy` to wireless-specific
crates.

- **`AnyMap` moved to `ndn-transport`** — the type-keyed extension map
  (`HashMap<TypeId, Box<dyn Any + Send + Sync>>`) now lives in
  `ndn-transport` so both `ndn-pipeline` and `ndn-strategy` can use it
  without a dependency cycle.  `ndn-pipeline` re-exports it for
  backward compatibility.
- **`StrategyContext::extensions: &AnyMap`** — new field gives strategies
  read-only access to cross-layer data inserted by enrichers.
- **`ContextEnricher` trait** (`ndn-engine`) — generic enrichment
  interface.  Implementations read from any data source (RadioTable,
  GPS, battery, etc.) and insert typed DTOs into the extensions map.
  Register via `EngineBuilder::context_enricher()`.
- **`LinkQualitySnapshot` / `FaceLinkQuality`** (`ndn-strategy`) —
  cross-layer DTOs with per-face RSSI, retransmit rate, RTT, and
  throughput.  All fields are `Option` for backward compatibility.

#### Strategy composition with filters

Strategies can now be composed with reusable filters that post-process
forwarding actions, without modifying the base strategy code.

- **`StrategyFilter` trait** (`ndn-strategy`) — post-processes
  `SmallVec<[ForwardingAction; 2]>` from an inner strategy.  Filters
  can remove faces, reorder, or inject actions.
- **`ComposedStrategy`** (`ndn-engine`) — wraps an inner
  `Arc<dyn ErasedStrategy>` plus a filter chain.  Implements
  `ErasedStrategy` directly; registered like any other strategy via
  `EngineBuilder::strategy()`.
- **`RssiFilter`** (`ndn-strategy`) — example filter that removes
  faces below a configurable RSSI threshold from `Forward` actions.
  If all faces are filtered out, the action is dropped (falls through
  to Nack).

#### WASM scripted strategies (`ndn-strategy-wasm`)

New crate enabling hot-loadable forwarding strategies compiled to
WebAssembly, for research prototyping and field hot-patching without
recompiling the router.

- **`WasmStrategy`** — loads a WASM module via `wasmtime`, runs on the
  sync fast path (`decide()`) with fuel-limited execution (~1–5µs).
- **Host-guest ABI** — `"ndn"` namespace imports: `get_in_face`,
  `get_nexthop_count`, `get_nexthop`, `get_rtt_ns`, `get_rssi`,
  `get_satisfaction`, `forward`, `nack`, `suppress`.
- **`WasmStrategy::from_bytes()` / `from_file()`** — load from
  in-memory bytes or a `.wasm` file on disk.
- **Fuel limit** — configurable instruction budget per invocation;
  fuel exhaustion returns `Suppress` (safety).
- **Memory limit** — 1 page (64 KiB) default, configurable.

#### Strategy examples

New `examples/` directory with four runnable examples demonstrating
the strategy extensibility tiers:

- **`strategy-custom`** — custom `RandomStrategy` implementing the
  `Strategy` trait with sync fast path and engine registration.
- **`strategy-composed`** — `ComposedStrategy` wrapping `BestRoute`
  with `RssiFilter` and a custom `LatencyFilter`.
- **`cross-layer-enricher`** — GPS-based `ContextEnricher` feeding
  location data into strategies via extensions.
- **`wasm-strategy`** — embedded WAT module loaded via
  `WasmStrategy::from_bytes()`.

#### Pluggable, manageable, observable content store

The content store is now a trait-based abstraction that researchers can
extend with new implementations, manage at runtime via NFD-compatible
commands, and instrument with observability hooks.

- **Object-safe `ErasedContentStore` trait** — wraps the `ContentStore`
  trait with boxed futures (same pattern as `ErasedStrategy`). The engine
  holds `Arc<dyn ErasedContentStore>`, allowing runtime polymorphism.
- **Extended `ContentStore` trait** — new methods with defaults:
  `len()`, `current_bytes()`, `set_capacity()`, `variant_name()`,
  `evict_prefix()`, `stats()`.
- **`LruCs` runtime capacity** — `capacity_bytes` changed from `usize`
  to `AtomicUsize` for lock-free runtime updates via `set_capacity()`.
- **`NameTrie::descendants()`** — DFS collection of all values under a
  prefix, needed for `evict_prefix`.
- **`EngineBuilder` CS methods** — `.content_store()`,
  `.admission_policy()`, `.cs_observer()` for plugging in custom
  implementations at build time. Defaults to `LruCs` + `DefaultAdmissionPolicy`.
- **TOML `[cs]` config section** — `variant` ("lru", "sharded-lru",
  "null"), `capacity_mb`, `shards`, `admission_policy`. Backward
  compatible with existing `engine.cs_capacity_mb`.
- **NFD management commands** — `cs/config` (get/set capacity),
  `cs/info` (entries, bytes, hit/miss counters, variant name),
  `cs/erase` (prefix-based eviction with optional count limit).
  `ControlParameters` extended with `capacity` (TLV 0x83) and `count`
  (TLV 0x84) fields.
- **`ndn-ctl` CLI** — `cs config --capacity <bytes>`, `cs erase <prefix>
  --count N`, `cs info`.
- **`MgmtClient`** — `cs_config()`, `cs_erase()` typed methods.
- **`ObservableCs` wrapper** — wraps any `ErasedContentStore` with
  atomic hit/miss/insert/eviction counters and an optional `CsObserver`
  callback. Zero overhead when no observer is registered.
- **`CsStats`** — snapshot struct for counter values, returned by
  `stats()` on all CS implementations.

### Fixed

#### Pipeline overload kills SHM applications via backpressure cascade

Under heavy load (e.g. CUBIC retransmit floods), the pipeline channel
(4096 slots) could fill up, causing face readers to block on
`tx.send()`.  This cascaded through the SHM ring (256 slots) to the
application, where `SpscHandle::send()` hit its yield limit and
returned `Closed` — killing the app even though the connection was
alive.  All subsequent runs got 0 throughput until the router restarted.

- **Face reader uses `try_send`** — inbound packets are dropped (not
  blocked) when the pipeline channel is full, same as outbound
  `enqueue_send`.  Prevents face readers from stalling, which broke
  the SHM backpressure chain that killed applications.
- **`SpscHandle::send()` uses wall-clock deadline** (5s) instead of a
  yield counter (100k iterations).  The old yield counter was
  system-speed-dependent and could falsely fire under Tokio contention,
  killing the app on transient load spikes.
- **iperf retransmit budget** — capped at `window/2` per check interval
  to prevent retransmit floods from overwhelming the pipeline in the
  first place.
- **iperf per-Interest retry limit** (`MAX_RETRIES = 3`) — Interests
  that fail 3 retransmits are marked as timed out and removed from the
  in-flight map, freeing window capacity for new Interests.

#### Consecutive iperf runs fail with PIT suppression (0 throughput)

Running `ndn-iperf client` a second time immediately after the first run
produced 0 throughput because Interest names `/iperf/0`, `/iperf/1`, ...
collided with stale PIT entries from the previous run.

- **Per-run flow ID** — each iperf client run now uses a unique flow prefix
  (`/iperf/<flow-id>/<seq>`) so names never collide between runs or
  concurrent clients.
- **PIT cleanup on face disconnect** — `Pit::remove_face()` drains PIT
  entries whose sole in-record consumer is the closed face, preventing stale
  entries from suppressing future Interests.  Called from `run_face_reader`
  on face close, before FIB cleanup.

#### AIMD/CUBIC congestion control produces inflated loss reports

Adaptive congestion control (aimd, cubic) nearly saturated the link but
reported 34–50% loss due to three compounding issues.

- **Unbounded slow start** — `ssthresh` defaulted to `f64::MAX`, so the
  window doubled every RTT and overshot link capacity in milliseconds on
  low-RTT links (SHM, localhost).  Now `--window` sets both the initial
  window and ssthresh, starting directly in congestion avoidance.
- **Per-packet loss events** — each stale Interest called `on_timeout()`
  individually, halving the window N times then re-inflating via slow
  start in rapid oscillation.  Now all stale Interests in a single
  retransmit check trigger one loss event.
- **In-flight inflation** — Interests still in the pipeline at test end
  were counted as lost.  Loss is now `(sent − in_flight_at_end − received)`
  with in-flight reported separately.
- **`CongestionController::with_ssthresh()`** — new builder method for
  explicit slow-start threshold control.

#### NDNLPv2 reliability lingering traffic after flow completion

High-throughput flows accumulated thousands of unacked entries that drained
at ~160 pkt/sec for minutes after the flow ended, flooding the remote with
retransmitted fragments ("unsolicited data").

- **Unacked map cap** (`MAX_UNACKED = 256`) — oldest entries evicted when
  the map is full.  Post-flow drain limited to ~1.6 seconds.

#### NDNLPv2 per-hop reliability for unicast UDP faces

Unicast UDP faces now implement NDNLPv2 per-hop reliability, fixing throughput
instability (400–850 Mbps variance) caused by unrecovered UDP packet loss.

- **LpPacket Ack field** — decode/encode Ack TLVs (0x0344), `fragment` is now
  `Option<Bytes>` to support bare Ack-only packets.
- **Per-fragment unique sequence** — each fragment gets `Sequence = base_seq + i`;
  reassembly key is `Sequence - FragIndex`.
- **`LpReliability` struct** (`ndn-face-net/src/reliability.rs`) — pure
  synchronous state machine: `on_send()` fragments + assigns TxSequences +
  piggybacks Acks; `on_receive()` queues Acks + measures RTT; `check_retransmit()`
  drives retransmits with adaptive RTO (RFC 6298, Karn's algorithm).
- **Engine integration** — `FaceState` holds optional `LpReliability` for UDP
  faces; `run_face_sender` has a 50ms retransmit tick; `run_face_reader` feeds
  inbound packets to `on_receive()`.
- **`FaceKind::Multicast`** — multicast UDP now has its own `FaceKind` variant
  (no reliability, no single peer to Ack).
- **UdpFace passthrough** — packets already wrapped as LpPackets (from the
  reliability layer) are sent directly, bypassing the face's own LpPacket
  wrapping and fragmentation.

#### Network listeners — UDP and TCP on port 6363

The router now listens for incoming network traffic at startup, matching NFD's
default behavior.

- **UDP listener** (`run_udp_listener`) — binds an unconnected socket on the
  configured address (default `0.0.0.0:6363`). Auto-creates a per-peer `UdpFace`
  on the first datagram from each new source address. Subsequent packets from
  that peer are injected directly into the pipeline.
- **TCP listener** (`run_tcp_listener`) — accepts incoming TCP connections and
  creates a `TcpFace` per connection with TLV length-prefix framing.
- **Default listeners** — when no `[[face]]` entries are present in the config
  (or no config file is given), the router automatically starts both UDP and TCP
  listeners on `0.0.0.0:6363`.
- **Config-driven** — `[[face]]` entries with `kind = "udp"` or `kind = "tcp"`
  and optional `bind` address are instantiated at startup.
- **`ForwarderEngine::inject_packet()`** — public method to push raw packets
  directly into the pipeline channel, used by listener tasks that manage their
  own recv loop.
- **`ndn_config::FaceKind`** re-exported from `ndn-config` crate root.

#### Ergonomic application library API

**ndn-packet (Name ergonomics):**
- **`impl FromStr for Name`** — parse NDN URI strings (`"/edu/ucla/data".parse()`)
  with percent-decoding; roundtrips with `Display`.
- **`Name::append()`, `append_component()`, `append_segment()`** — by-value builder
  methods for chaining: `prefix.clone().append("data").append_segment(42)`.
- **`name!()` macro** — compile-time name construction: `name!("/iperf/data")`.
- **`impl From<&str>` / `From<String>` for `Name`** — enables `InterestBuilder::new("/test")`.
- **`SEGMENT` TLV type constant** (`0x32`).

**ndn-packet (Packet builders):**
- **`InterestBuilder`** — configurable Interest encoder with `lifetime()`,
  `can_be_prefix()`, `must_be_fresh()`, `hop_limit()`, `app_parameters()`.
- **`DataBuilder`** — configurable Data encoder with `freshness()` and async
  `.sign(sig_type, key_locator, sign_fn)` for cryptographic signing.

**ndn-app (Consumer/Producer):**
- **`Consumer`** — high-level fetch API: `connect()`, `fetch()`, `get()`,
  `fetch_verified()` (with `Validator` integration).
- **`Producer`** — high-level serve API: `connect()`, `serve()` with async handler.
- **`NdnConnection`** — unified enum over `AppHandle` (embedded) and `RouterClient`
  (external).
- **`KeyChain`** — simplified security facade: `create_identity()`, `signer()`,
  `validator()`. Wraps `SecurityManager` + `FilePib`.
- **`blocking` module** — `BlockingConsumer` / `BlockingProducer` behind `blocking`
  feature flag; internal tokio runtime hidden from users (reqwest-style pattern).
- **`prelude` module** — ergonomic imports: `Name`, `Interest`, `Data`,
  `InterestBuilder`, `DataBuilder`, `Consumer`, `Producer`, `KeyChain`, `AppError`.

**ndn-security:**
- **`Signer::public_key()`** — optional trait method returning raw public key bytes.
- **`SecurityManager::get_signer_sync()`** — synchronous signer lookup for non-async
  contexts.
- **`MemKeyStore::get_signer_sync()`** — made public.

#### Face scope enforcement

`/localhost` prefix security boundary — packets with names starting with
`/localhost` are confined to local faces only, matching NFD behavior.

- **`FaceScope` enum** (`Local`, `NonLocal`) in `ndn-transport` — derived from
  `FaceKind` (`Unix`/`App`/`Shm`/`Internal` → Local, all others → NonLocal).
- **`FaceKind::scope()`** method for querying face locality.
- **Inbound filtering** — `TlvDecodeStage` drops `/localhost` Interest, Data, and
  Nack packets arriving on non-local faces (`DropReason::ScopeViolation`).
- **Outbound filtering** — `PacketDispatcher` skips non-local faces when forwarding
  or satisfying `/localhost`-prefixed packets.

#### Face persistence (on-demand / persistent / permanent)

NFD-compatible face lifecycle management with three persistence levels.

- **`FacePersistency` enum** (`OnDemand`, `Persistent`, `Permanent`) in
  `ndn-transport` — mirrors NFD semantics with `from_u64()` constructor.
- **`FaceState`** replaces bare `CancellationToken` per face — tracks cancel token,
  persistency level, and last-activity timestamp (`AtomicU64` nanoseconds).
- **Persistency-aware cleanup** in `run_face_reader`:
  - *Permanent*: retries on recv errors indefinitely (only cancellation stops it).
  - *Persistent*: stops the recv loop on error but retains the face in table/FIB.
  - *OnDemand*: fully removes face from table and cleans FIB routes (existing behavior).
- **Idle face timeout** — background sweep task (`run_idle_face_task`) runs every 30s,
  removing on-demand faces idle for >5 minutes.
- **Management integration** — `faces/create` uses `Persistent` by default;
  listener-accepted faces use `OnDemand`; `faces/list` shows persistency level.
- **Per-face outbound send queue** — each face now has a bounded `mpsc` channel
  (128 slots) with a dedicated send task, matching NFD's `GenericLinkService`
  output queue model.  The pipeline runner enqueues packets via non-blocking
  `try_send` and is never blocked by face I/O.  Benefits:
  - *TCP ordering preserved*: per-face sequential sends prevent interleaved TLV
    framing corruption that `tokio::spawn`-per-send would cause.
  - *Bounded backpressure*: full queues drop packets (congestion drop semantics —
    consumers re-express Interests).
  - *Pipeline decoupled from I/O*: fragmented UDP sends (~35 µs for 7 fragments)
    no longer block all other packet processing.
  - *Persistency-aware error handling*: `run_face_sender` retries on permanent
    faces, cleans up on-demand faces on send error.

#### NDNLPv2 fragmentation and reassembly

Automatic fragmentation/reassembly for packets exceeding the UDP MTU (~1400 bytes),
enabling reliable transport of large NDN Data packets (~8800 bytes) over UDP.

- **`ndn_packet::fragment` module** (new):
  - `fragment_packet()` — splits a packet into MTU-sized NDNLPv2 LpPacket fragments
    with `Sequence`, `FragIndex`, and `FragCount` fields.
  - `ReassemblyBuffer` — per-peer stateful reassembly keyed by sequence number,
    with configurable timeout and `purge_expired()` for cleanup.
  - `DEFAULT_UDP_MTU` constant (1400 bytes).
- **Outbound fragmentation** — `UdpFace` and `MulticastUdpFace` automatically
  fragment packets larger than the MTU before sending. Each face maintains an
  atomic sequence counter for fragment identification.
- **Inbound reassembly** — `TlvDecodeStage` maintains a per-face
  `DashMap<FaceId, ReassemblyBuffer>`. Fragmented LpPackets are reassembled in
  the pipeline before TLV decoding, keeping the Face layer protocol-agnostic and
  avoiding duplicate reassembly logic in listeners and individual face types.

#### Multicast LpPacket wrapping

- **`MulticastUdpFace::send()`** now wraps outgoing packets in NDNLPv2 LpPacket
  framing, consistent with `UdpFace` and `TcpFace`.

### Fixed

#### UDP listener faces reply from wrong source port

Listener-created UDP faces used a dedicated ephemeral-port socket for sending.
When the remote peer's face filters by source address (expecting replies from
port 6363), replies from an ephemeral port were silently dropped — causing
cross-machine ndn-ping to timeout even though Interests reached the server.

This mirrors NFD's UdpChannel design: the listener owns a single socket and
all per-peer faces share it for sending via `send_to`.  No recv loop is
spawned for these faces — the listener demuxes inbound datagrams and injects
them into the pipeline via `inject_packet`.

- **`UdpFace::from_shared_socket()`** — new constructor accepting an
  `Arc<UdpSocket>` so listener-created faces share the listener's socket.
- **`ForwarderEngine::add_face_send_only()`** — registers a face without
  spawning a recv loop (the listener handles inbound demux).
- **UDP listener** uses both to create per-peer faces that reply from the
  well-known listener port.

#### SHM wakeup: unified FIFO path, eliminated `spawn_blocking` on Linux

The Linux futex + `spawn_blocking` wakeup path routed every park/unpark
through Tokio's blocking thread pool.  At 100K+ packets/sec this caused
Linux SHM throughput to be 2–4× lower than macOS (which used named FIFOs
with `AsyncFd` integrated directly into the epoll loop).

- **Unified wakeup mechanism** — both Linux and macOS now use named FIFO pipes
  wrapped in `tokio::io::unix::AsyncFd`, integrating directly into Tokio's
  epoll/kqueue loop with zero thread transitions.
- **Removed all `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` branching** from `spsc.rs` —
  the entire SPSC face implementation is now platform-agnostic.
- **Removed futex syscall helpers** — `futex_wait()` and `futex_wake_one()`
  no longer needed.

#### Cross-process SHM futex on Linux

The `atomic-wait` crate uses `FUTEX_PRIVATE_FLAG`, which keys on virtual
addresses and only works within a single process.  SHM faces share memory
across processes via POSIX `shm_open`, so the futex must key on the physical
page offset — requiring plain `FUTEX_WAIT` / `FUTEX_WAKE` without the private
flag.

- **Replaced `atomic-wait` with direct futex syscalls** — `futex_wait()` and
  `futex_wake_one()` call `libc::SYS_futex` without `FUTEX_PRIVATE_FLAG`.
- **Timed futex wait (100ms)** — prevents `spawn_blocking` threads from hanging
  indefinitely during shutdown (Ctrl+C), since tokio waits for all blocking
  tasks before the runtime drops.
- **Removed `atomic-wait` dependency** from workspace and `ndn-face-local`.

#### SHM face cleanup on app disconnect

- **SHM faces now use `OnDemand` persistency** instead of `Persistent`.  When
  the control face disconnects (app exits), the child cancel token fires and
  the SHM face is fully cleaned up: SHM region unlinked, FIB routes removed,
  face removed from table.

#### Pipeline stage tracing

Per-packet `trace!`-level instrumentation across all forwarding pipeline stages,
enabling end-to-end packet journey debugging with `RUST_LOG=ndn_engine=trace,ndn_face_net=trace`.

**ndn-engine:**
- **TlvDecodeStage** — traces Interest/Data/Nack decode results, LpPacket unwrap,
  HopLimit exceeded, malformed packets, and unknown TLV types.
- **CsLookupStage** — traces cache HIT / MISS per Interest.
- **CsInsertStage** — traces Data insertion with freshness period and admission
  policy rejections.
- **PitCheckStage** — traces loop detection (duplicate nonce), Interest aggregation
  (suppression), and new PIT entry creation with nonce and lifetime.
- **PitMatchStage** — traces PIT satisfaction (with out-faces list) and unsolicited
  Data drops.
- **StrategyStage** — traces FIB LPM result (hit with nexthops / miss), strategy
  selection (name), and forwarding decision (Forward, ForwardAfter, Nack, Suppress).
- **PacketDispatcher** — traces packet arrival (face, length), pipeline routing
  (Interest/Data/Nack), dispatch actions (Send with target faces, Satisfy with
  out-faces and CS hit flag, Nack with reason), per-face send success, and face-
  not-found warnings.

**ndn-face-net:**
- **UdpFace** — traces send/recv with face ID, peer address, and packet length.
- **TcpFace** — traces send/recv with face ID, remote address, and packet length.

### Changed

- **`ndn-iperf` rewritten** to use the new application library API:
  - Server uses `DataBuilder` (with optional `.sign()` via `KeyChain`) instead of
    raw `encode_data_unsigned()`.
  - Client uses `InterestBuilder` with configurable `.lifetime()` instead of
    `encode_interest()`.
  - New `--sign` flag on server: generates ephemeral Ed25519 identity and signs
    every Data packet (for measuring signing overhead).
  - New `--freshness` option on server for configurable Data freshness period.
  - New `--lifetime` option on client for configurable Interest lifetime.
  - New `--interval` option on both sides for reporting period (default 1s).
  - New `--quiet` / `-q` flag to suppress periodic status reports.
  - Live per-interval throughput/packet-rate/RTT reporting via lock-free atomics.
  - Richer final summary: human-readable sizes, loss percentage, min/max/percentile
    RTT, timeout count.
  - Status output on stderr, final results on stdout (allows piping/parsing).
  - Shared `ConnectOpts` struct via `#[command(flatten)]`.
- **`ndn-ping` rewritten** to use the application library API and real network I/O:
  - Replaced simulated ping loop with actual `RouterClient` communication.
  - Server mode: registers prefix, responds to ping Interests with `DataBuilder`,
    optional Ed25519 signing (`--sign`), configurable freshness.
  - Client mode: sends ping Interests with `InterestBuilder`, measures real RTT,
    prints per-packet timing and statistical summary (min/avg/max/p50/p99/stddev).
  - Uses clap for CLI parsing with `ConnectOpts` (`--face-socket`, `--no-shm`).
  - Supports unlimited pings (`--count 0`), configurable interval and lifetime.
- All tools (`ndn-iperf`, `ndn-traffic`, `ndn-ping`, `ndn-peek`, `ndn-put`,
  `ndn-ctl`, `ndn-sec`, `ndn-bench`, `ndn-router`) now use `Name::from_str()`
  instead of duplicated `parse_name()` functions, and `Name::Display` instead of
  duplicated `format_name()` functions.
- Tool name-building code simplified with `Name::append()` (e.g.,
  `prefix.clone().append(format!("{seq}"))` replaces iterator chains).

#### Embedded engine integration tests (Android/mobile readiness)

- **`crates/ndn-app/tests/embedded.rs`** — end-to-end tests demonstrating the
  embedded forwarding pattern: `ForwarderEngine` + `AppFace` + `Consumer`/`Producer`
  running entirely in-process with no external router, Unix sockets, or SHM.
- Three tests: single fetch, sequential multi-fetch, and `Consumer::get()`.
- Module-level documentation on `ndn-app` with code examples for both connection
  modes (external router and embedded engine).
- Verified: all pure-Rust crates cross-check for `aarch64-linux-android`; crates
  using `ring` require Android NDK (ring tier-1 target, no code changes needed).

### Fixed

- **UDP face broken pipe on macOS** — `UdpFace` switched from a connected socket
  (`connect()` + `send`/`recv`) to an unconnected socket (`send_to`/`recv_from`).
  On macOS/BSD, a connected UDP socket that receives ICMP port-unreachable enters a
  permanent error state where all subsequent `send()` calls fail with `EPIPE`
  (broken pipe). The unconnected approach makes each datagram independent at the
  kernel level. `recv_from` filters by peer address to maintain single-peer semantics.
- **NDNLPv2 framing on outbound network packets** — `UdpFace::send()` and
  `TcpFace::send()` now wrap bare Interest/Data in an NDNLPv2 `LpPacket(Fragment(...))`
  envelope via `encode_lp_packet()`. NFD and ndn-cxx require LpPacket framing on
  unicast links; bare TLV type 0x05/0x06 was silently dropped by remote forwarders.

**Wire-format interoperability (ndnd/ndn-cxx compatibility):**
- **NonNegativeInteger encoding now uses minimal lengths** (1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes
  per NDN Packet Format v0.3 §1.2). Previously always used 8 bytes for
  InterestLifetime and FreshnessPeriod, wasting 6 bytes per packet.
- **`DataBuilder::build()` omits MetaInfo** when no freshness is set, instead of
  emitting `FreshnessPeriod=0` (which means "immediately stale" — semantically
  different from absent MetaInfo).
- **SignatureType and NackReason encoding** now uses valid NNI lengths. Previously
  stripped leading zeros without rounding up to {1,2,4,8}, which could produce
  invalid 3/5/6/7-byte encodings for values ≥256.
- Added 14 wire-format interop tests verifying byte-exact encoding output and
  successful decoding of hand-crafted packets matching ndnd/ndn-cxx wire format.

### Removed

- 8 duplicated `parse_name()` functions across tool binaries.
- 3 duplicated `format_name()` functions (replaced by `Name`'s `Display` impl).

### Added

#### NFD-compatible management protocol

Full NFD management protocol implementation using binary TLV encoding
(ControlParameters 0x68, ControlResponse 0x65) with standard NFD name
conventions (`/localhost/nfd/<module>/<verb>/<ControlParameters>`).

**ndn-config:**
- **ControlParameters TLV codec** (`control_parameters.rs`) — encode/decode all
  NFD ControlParameters fields: Name, FaceId, Uri, Origin, Cost, Flags, Mask,
  ExpirationPeriod, FacePersistency, Strategy, Mtu.
- **ControlResponse TLV codec** (`control_response.rs`) — encode/decode
  StatusCode, StatusText, and optional ControlParameters body. Standard status
  codes: 200 OK, 400 bad params, 403 unauthorized, 404 not found, 409 conflict.
- **NFD command name builder/parser** (`nfd_command.rs`) — `command_name()`,
  `dataset_name()`, and `parse_command_name()` for constructing and parsing
  management Interest names. Module/verb constants for all NFD modules.

**ndn-engine:**
- **Per-prefix strategy table** — `StrategyTable<dyn ErasedStrategy>` wired into
  `EngineInner`. `StrategyStage` performs LPM on the strategy table before
  dispatching to the matched strategy. Default strategy seeded at root.
- **`ErasedStrategy::name()`** — added to the object-safe strategy trait so
  management handlers can report strategy names.
- **`ForwarderEngine::strategy_table()`** — public accessor for the engine's
  strategy table.
- **`ForwarderEngine::source_face_id()`** — resolves the originating face of an
  Interest via PIT in-record lookup, enabling "FaceId defaults to requesting
  face" NFD behavior.

**ndn-store:**
- **`StrategyTable` `?Sized` support** — type parameter accepts trait objects
  (`dyn ErasedStrategy`).
- **`StrategyTable::dump()`** — returns all (prefix, strategy) entries for status
  reporting.
- **`LruCs::len()`, `is_empty()`, `current_bytes()`** — public accessors for CS
  status reporting.

**ndn-strategy:**
- **NFD-style strategy names** — `BestRouteStrategy::strategy_name()` returns
  `/localhost/nfd/strategy/best-route`; `MulticastStrategy::strategy_name()`
  returns `/localhost/nfd/strategy/multicast`.

**ndn-router (`mgmt_ndn.rs`):**
- **RIB module** — `rib/register`, `rib/unregister`, `rib/list`. FaceId defaults
  to requesting face when omitted. Routes use NFD origin/flags/cost semantics.
- **Faces module** — `faces/create` (supports `shm://`, `unix://`, `tcp4://`,
  `udp4://` URIs), `faces/destroy`, `faces/list` (reports face IDs and kinds).
- **FIB module** — `fib/add-nexthop`, `fib/remove-nexthop`, `fib/list` (reports
  prefix and nexthops).
- **Strategy-choice module** — `strategy-choice/set` (creates strategy by name,
  inserts into strategy table), `strategy-choice/unset` (blocks unsetting root),
  `strategy-choice/list` (shows prefix→strategy mappings).
- **CS module** — `cs/config` (reports capacity), `cs/info` (reports capacity,
  entries, memory usage).
- **Status module** — `status/general` (faces/fib/pit/cs counts),
  `status/shutdown`.

**ndn-ipc:**
- **`RouterClient`** (`router_client.rs`) — app-side abstraction for connecting
  to ndn-router. Connects via UnixFace, optionally creates SHM data plane face.
  Provides `register_prefix()`, `unregister_prefix()`, `send()`, `recv()`.

**ndn-tools (`ndn-ctl`):**
- **NFD TLV transport** — primary transport sends ControlParameters-encoded
  Interests over UnixFace. Legacy JSON bypass retained with `--bypass` flag.
- **New commands** — `strategy-set`, `strategy-unset`, `strategy-list`, `cs-info`.

**ndn-tools (`ndn-iperf`):**
- **External mode** — rewritten as external server/client that connects to a
  running ndn-router via `RouterClient`. SHM data plane preferred, Unix socket
  fallback.

### Changed

- **ndn-engine pipeline architecture** — the pipeline runner performs fragment
  sieve and channel drain inline (single-threaded), then spawns per-packet
  tokio tasks for full pipeline processing across multiple cores.  This
  replaced an earlier fully-inline design that saturated a single core at
  ~850 Mbps on UDP workloads with fragmentation.
- **ndn-router management prefix** changed from custom to `/localhost/nfd` (NFD
  standard).
- **ndn-engine `StrategyStage`** now uses `strategy_table` + `default_strategy`
  instead of a single global strategy.
- **ndn-engine dispatcher nack pipeline** updated to use strategy table LPM for
  per-prefix strategy dispatch on Nack.
- **`dispatch_action()` and `satisfy()` are now synchronous** — no longer async;
  use `enqueue_send()` (non-blocking `try_send` to per-face channel) instead of
  awaiting `face.send_bytes()`.  The nack pipeline's retry-forward and
  nack-propagation paths also use `enqueue_send`.
- **Configurable parallel pipeline processing** — `pipeline_threads` setting
  in `[engine]` config (default `0` = auto-detect).  `1` runs all processing
  inline in the pipeline runner (lowest latency, deterministic ordering).
  `N > 1` spawns per-packet tokio tasks so up to N pipeline passes run in
  parallel across cores (highest throughput with fragmented UDP traffic).
  The fragment sieve always runs single-threaded.  `PacketDispatcher` is
  `Arc`-wrapped for shared access; all pipeline stages are concurrent-safe
  (DashMap for PIT, Mutex for CS, Arc for shared tables).
- **PIT match order swapped** — `PitMatchStage` now tries the default-selector
  token first (common case for most Interests), then falls back to the
  None-selector token.  Eliminates a wasted DashMap probe + hash computation
  per Data packet.
- **Send queue capacity** increased from 128 to 512 to absorb bursts from
  parallel pipeline tasks dispatching to the same face near-simultaneously.
- **CS empty-check bypass** — `LruCs` maintains an atomic entry count.
  `get()` returns `None` immediately when the count is zero, skipping
  the global Mutex entirely.  Eliminates the main serialization point for
  parallel pipeline tasks on workloads that don't cache (e.g. iperf).
- **Strategy sync fast-path** — `ErasedStrategy::decide_sync()` lets
  strategies return a forwarding decision without `Box::pin` heap
  allocation.  `BestRouteStrategy` and `MulticastStrategy` implement
  this, avoiding one allocation per Interest on the hot path.
- **Synchronous signing fast-path** — `Signer::sign_sync()` method
  eliminates `Box::pin` + async state machine overhead for CPU-only
  signers.  `Ed25519Signer` and `HmacSha256Signer` implement this
  directly, removing one heap allocation per Data packet when signing.
- **`DataBuilder::sign_sync()`** — synchronous single-buffer packet
  encoding.  The async `sign()` path allocated 3–4 intermediate buffers
  (two `TlvWriter`s, one concatenation `Vec`, one final `TlvWriter`)
  and copied the entire signed region to satisfy lifetime constraints.
  `sign_sync()` builds the signed region incrementally in one pre-sized
  buffer, snapshots it for the signing closure, then writes the outer
  Data TLV — eliminating ~1.2M allocations/sec at line rate.
- **HMAC-SHA256 signer** — `HmacSha256Signer` in `ndn-security` for
  symmetric (pre-shared key) authentication using `ring::hmac`.
  Significantly faster than Ed25519 (~10×) for scenarios where
  asymmetric key distribution is unnecessary.
- **`ndn-iperf` signing fast-path** — server `--sign` and `--hmac`
  modes now use inline `sign_sync` + `DataBuilder::sign_sync()`,
  eliminating per-packet `Box::pin`, 8 KB `region.to_vec()` copy, and
  3 intermediate buffer allocations from the async signing path.
- **`ndn-iperf --hmac` flag** — server-side HMAC-SHA256 signing mode
  for benchmarking signing overhead without the cost of elliptic curve
  math.

### Fixed

- **Stale FIB routes on face disconnect** — when a face is removed from the face
  table, `Fib::remove_face` now purges all nexthops pointing to that face across
  all prefixes. Previously, stale nexthops accumulated when applications
  reconnected with new face IDs, causing `BestRouteStrategy` to forward Interests
  to dead faces (0 Mbps throughput when switching between SHM and Unix modes).
- **SHM face cleanup on app disconnect** — each accepted connection now gets a
  per-connection `CancellationToken` (child of the global token). SHM faces
  created via `faces/create` use a child of the control face's token. When the
  control face disconnects, the token cascade cancels the SHM face reader,
  triggering FIB and face table cleanup. Previously, SHM faces on macOS stayed
  blocked forever on FIFOs that never signaled EOF.
- **SHM spin-before-park** — added a 64-iteration spin loop in both `SpscFace`
  and `SpscHandle` recv before falling through to the pipe/futex sleep. Avoids
  expensive wakeup syscalls when packets arrive within microseconds of each other.
- **SHM ring capacity** increased from 64 to 256 slots — reduces backpressure
  during burst traffic and gives headroom for pipeline processing jitter.
- **SHM liveness detection for dead router** — `SpscHandle::recv()` races the
  pipe wakeup against a `CancellationToken` propagated from the control face.
  When the router dies, the token fires and recv returns `None` promptly.
  `SpscHandle::send()` uses a bounded yield loop (100K iterations) that returns
  `ShmError::Closed` if the ring stays full or the token fires. `pipe_await`
  now returns `Err` on EOF (n==0) instead of looping forever.
- **`RouterClient` liveness tracking** — `RouterClient` now carries a
  `CancellationToken` and `dead` flag. SHM handles receive a child token from the
  control face. `probe_alive()` sends a probe Interest on the control face and
  cancels the token on failure, causing SHM recv/send to abort promptly.
- **Idle sweep skips local faces** — `run_idle_face_task` now skips App, Shm, and
  Internal faces when checking for idle timeouts. Previously SHM faces were killed
  after 5 minutes of apparent inactivity (the idle sweep didn't track local face
  activity), causing iperf sessions to fail at ~324 seconds.

#### NDN spec compliance — SPEC-GAPS.md tracker and fixes

25-item spec compliance audit against RFC 8569, NDN Packet Format v0.3, and
NDNLPv2. Created `SPEC-GAPS.md` checklist. All 25 gaps resolved:

**ndn-tlv:**
- **VarNumber shortest-encoding validation** — `read_varu64` rejects non-minimal
  VarNumber forms (e.g. 3-byte encoding for values < 253).
- **TlvWriter minimal nested encoding** — `write_nested` now uses a temporary
  buffer and writes minimal-length encoding instead of a fixed 5-byte placeholder.
- **Types 0–31 grandfathered as critical** — `skip_unknown` treats types 0–31 as
  critical regardless of LSB parity, per NDN Packet Format v0.3 §1.3.

**ndn-packet:**
- **Ed25519 signature type code** — fixed from 7 to 5 per spec §10.3.
- **HopLimit decode** — `Interest::hop_limit()` lazily decodes TLV 0x22.
- **Nonce insertion** — `ensure_nonce()` adds a generated Nonce to Interests
  that lack one; called in TlvDecodeStage.
- **Zero-component Name rejection** — Interest and Data decoders reject empty Names.
- **ForwardingHint decode** — `Interest::forwarding_hint()` parses delegation Names
  from TLV 0x1E.
- **NDNLPv2 LpPacket module** (`lp.rs`) — decode/encode for LpPacket (0x64) with
  Nack header, CongestionMark, and Fragment fields.
- **Nack LpPacket framing** — `encode_nack` produces NDNLPv2-compliant LpPacket
  instead of bare 0x0320 TLV. `Nack::decode` accepts both formats.
- **ParametersSha256DigestComponent** — encoder computes SHA-256 digest; decoder
  validates both presence and correctness against ApplicationParameters.
- **`PacketError::MalformedPacket`** variant added for semantic validation errors.
- **Signed Interest support** — `Interest::sig_info()`, `sig_value()`, and
  `signed_region()` decode InterestSignatureInfo (0x2C) and InterestSignatureValue
  (0x2E) lazily; signed region covers Name through SigInfo for verification.
- **Signed Interest TLV constants** — `INTEREST_SIGNATURE_INFO`, `INTEREST_SIGNATURE_VALUE`,
  `SIGNATURE_NONCE`, `SIGNATURE_TIME`, `SIGNATURE_SEQ_NUM` added to `tlv_type`.
- **Anti-replay fields** — `SignatureInfo` decodes `sig_nonce` (0x26), `sig_time`
  (0x28), and `sig_seq_num` (0x2A) for signed Interest anti-replay protection.
- **Implicit SHA-256 digest** — `Data::implicit_digest()` computes SHA-256 of
  full wire encoding for exact Data retrieval via ImplicitSha256DigestComponent.
- **Link object support** — `Data::link_delegations()` parses delegation Names
  from Content field when ContentType=LINK.
- **NDNLPv2 fragmentation fields** — `LpPacket` decodes Sequence (0x51),
  FragIndex (0x52), and FragCount (0x53); `is_fragmented()` helper method.

**ndn-store:**
- **CS implicit digest lookup** — `LruCs::get` handles Interests with
  ImplicitSha256DigestComponent (type 0x01) by stripping the digest, looking up
  the Data name, and verifying the hash matches.
- **CS admission policy** — `CsAdmissionPolicy` trait with `DefaultAdmissionPolicy`
  (rejects FreshnessPeriod=0 Data) and `AdmitAllPolicy`. `CsInsertStage` consults
  the policy before caching.

**ndn-pipeline:**
- **`DropReason::HopLimitExceeded`** variant for HopLimit=0 enforcement.

**ndn-engine:**
- **TlvDecodeStage** — unwraps NDNLPv2 LpPackets, enforces HopLimit=0 drop,
  inserts Nonce, propagates CongestionMark via pipeline tags.
- **PIT aggregation** — `PitToken::from_interest_full` includes ForwardingHint
  in the hash key per RFC 8569 §4.2.

**ndn-store:**
- **`PitToken::from_interest_full`** — hashes (Name, Selector, ForwardingHint).

#### `ndn-security` — TLV certificate encoding and engine wiring

- **`certify()` full TLV encoding** — `SecurityManager::certify` now encodes a
  complete NDN certificate Data packet and signs it with the issuer's key:
  - Name: the subject key name
  - MetaInfo: `ContentType = KEY (2)`, `FreshnessPeriod = 3600000 ms`
  - Content: raw public key bytes + `ValidityPeriod` sub-TLV with
    `NotBefore`/`NotAfter` timestamps
  - SignatureInfo: `SignatureEd25519` with `KeyLocator` pointing to the issuer
  - SignatureValue: Ed25519 signature over the signed region

  The `MemKeyStoreExt` stub that always returned `CertNotFound` is replaced with
  `MemKeyStore::get_signer_sync`, a `pub(crate)` synchronous accessor that reads
  the DashMap directly.

  Helper: `encode_cert_data` builds the signed region, signs it, and wraps the
  result in an outer Data TLV.

- **`TlvWriter::write_raw`** — new method for embedding pre-encoded bytes
  (e.g., a signed region) into an outer TLV without re-framing.

- **`ndn-tlv` promoted to regular dependency** of `ndn-security` (was dev-only).

- **Engine wiring** — `EngineBuilder::security(mgr)` stores an
  `Arc<SecurityManager>` in `EngineInner`.  `ForwarderEngine::security()` exposes
  it.  `ndn-engine` now depends on `ndn-security`.

- **Router wiring** — `load_security` now returns `Option<SecurityManager>`
  instead of discarding it.  When a PIB identity is configured, the manager is
  passed to `EngineBuilder::security()`.

  Tests: `certify_produces_signed_cert`, `certify_fails_with_unknown_issuer`.

#### `ndn-packet` — Nack encoding

- **`encode_nack(reason, interest_wire)`** — encodes a Nack TLV (`0x0320`)
  wrapping the original Interest with the given `NackReason`. The Interest TLV
  is stripped of its outer wrapper and embedded as a child — matching the format
  expected by `Nack::decode`. Tests: `nack_roundtrip`, `nack_congestion_roundtrip`.

#### `ndn-engine` — NACK handling and ForwardAfter delay scheduling

- **Inbound NACK pipeline** — `nack_pipeline` in `PacketDispatcher` handles
  incoming Nack packets end-to-end:
  1. Looks up the PIT entry by the nacked Interest's name/selectors.
  2. Builds a `StrategyContext` and calls `on_nack_erased` on the strategy.
  3. If the strategy returns `Forward(faces)` — retries on alternate nexthops.
  4. If the strategy returns `Nack` — propagates the Nack to all in-record
     consumers and removes the PIT entry.
  5. `Suppress` / `ForwardAfter` — drops silently.

- **Outbound NACK dispatch** — `Action::Nack` now carries `PacketContext`
  (breaking change to the enum variant). `dispatch_action` encodes a Nack TLV
  via `encode_nack` and sends it back to `ctx.face_id`.

- **`ErasedStrategy::on_nack_erased`** — object-safe boxed-future wrapper for
  `Strategy::on_nack`, added alongside the existing `after_receive_interest_erased`.

- **ForwardAfter delay scheduling** — `StrategyStage` now spawns a Tokio timer
  for `ForwardAfter { faces, delay }` instead of forwarding immediately.  The
  delayed task re-checks the PIT before sending: if the entry was already
  satisfied or expired, the Interest is not forwarded.  The `StrategyStage`
  struct now holds `Arc<Pit>` and `Arc<FaceTable>` for this purpose.

#### `ndn-face-l2` — NamedEtherFace with TPACKET_V2 mmap ring buffers

- **`NamedEtherFace`** — NDN face over raw Ethernet (`AF_PACKET` + `SOCK_DGRAM`,
  Ethertype `0x8624`).  Uses TPACKET_V2 mmap'd ring buffers for zero-copy packet
  I/O instead of per-packet `recvfrom`/`sendto` syscalls.

  **Ring buffer design:**
  - `PacketRing` struct manages the mmap'd region (RX ring at offset 0, TX ring
    immediately after).  Ring geometry: 2048 B frames, 4 KiB blocks, 32 blocks
    per ring → 64 frames × 2 rings = 256 KiB total.
  - `try_pop_rx()` — checks `tp_status & TP_STATUS_USER` with Acquire ordering,
    reads payload at `frame + tp_mac`, releases frame with `TP_STATUS_KERNEL`.
  - `try_push_tx()` — Mutex-protected; writes payload at `frame + TX_DATA_OFFSET`
    (52 bytes: `TPACKET_ALIGN(sizeof(tpacket2_hdr))` + `sizeof(sockaddr_ll)`),
    sets `TP_STATUS_SEND_REQUEST` with Release ordering.
  - `Face::recv` polls `try_pop_rx()`, falling back to `AsyncFd::readable()` +
    `clear_ready()` when the ring is empty.
  - `Face::send` polls `try_push_tx()`, then calls `sendto(fd, NULL, 0, ...)`
    to flush all pending TX frames to the kernel.

  **Helpers:** `MacAddr` (6-byte address with `Display`), `get_ifindex` (via
  `SIOCGIFINDEX`), `make_sockaddr_ll`, `open_packet_socket` (non-blocking,
  `SOCK_CLOEXEC`), `setup_packet_ring` (TPACKET_V2 + RX/TX ring config + mmap).

  Requires `CAP_NET_RAW` or root.  Linux only (`#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`).

  Tests: `mac_addr_display`, `mac_addr_broadcast`, `sockaddr_ll_layout`,
  `ring_geometry`, `tx_data_offset_is_correct`, `new_fails_without_cap_net_raw`,
  `loopback_roundtrip` (ignored — needs root).

#### `ndn-sync` — Dataset synchronisation protocols

- **`SvsNode`** — State Vector Sync node. Maintains a `HashMap<String, u64>` state vector
  (node key → highest seen sequence number). `advance()` increments the local seq;
  `merge(received)` updates entries and returns `(node, gap_from, gap_to)` tuples for
  missing data; `snapshot()` serialises the full vector.

- **`PSyncNode` / `Ibf`** — Partial Sync via Invertible Bloom Filters. `Ibf` implements
  insert, remove, subtract, and `decode()` with a per-cell `hash_sum` checksum (splitmix64
  finalizer) to distinguish genuine pure cells from coincidental `xor_sum` collisions.
  Cell selection uses the splitmix64 finalizer seeded with the element value XOR'd with the
  hash-function index, giving good distribution even for structurally similar name hashes.
  `PSyncNode::reconcile(peer_ibf)` returns the symmetric difference as two `HashSet<u64>`
  values — hashes the local node has that the peer lacks, and vice versa.

#### `ndn-compute` — In-network compute

- **`ComputeRegistry`** — `NameTrie`-backed longest-prefix dispatch to
  `Arc<dyn ErasedHandler>`. `register<H: ComputeHandler>(prefix, handler)` adds a handler;
  `dispatch(interest)` does an LPM lookup and returns the handler's async result.
- **`ComputeFace`** — `Face` implementation that forwards Interests to the `ComputeRegistry`.
  `recv()` returns `pending()` (this face only injects Data, never receives from the network).

#### `ndn-research` — Research extensions

- **`FlowTable`** — `DashMap`-backed per-prefix flow entry (preferred face, EWMA throughput,
  EWMA RTT). `flush_interface(face_id)` atomically removes all entries for a face (called on
  radio channel switch).
- **`FlowObserverStage`** — Non-blocking `PipelineStage` that emits `FlowEvent`s via
  `try_send`. Optional `sampling_rate` (0.0–1.0) limits observer overhead on high-rate
  testbeds. Never slows the forwarding path.
- **`ChannelManager`** — nl80211 channel switch stub. `switch(face_id, channel)` returns
  `Err(SwitchError::NotImplemented)` until netlink integration is added.

#### Binaries

- **`ndn-router`** — Standalone forwarder: initialises tracing, builds engine with
  `EngineConfig::default()`, waits for Ctrl-C, then shuts down cleanly.
- **`ndn-peek`** — Parses `<name>` and `--timeout-ms` arguments, constructs an `Interest`,
  and prints the fetch plan. Forwarder connection not yet wired.
- **`ndn-ping`** — Sends `count` probe Interests to `prefix/ping/<seq>` at `interval-ms`
  spacing, measures RTT, and prints min/avg/max. Forwarder connection not yet wired.
- **`ndn-put`** — Reads a file, segments it with `ChunkedProducer`, and logs per-segment
  sizes. Accepts `--chunk-size`. Forwarder connection not yet wired.
- **`ndn-bench`** — Embeds an engine, drives Interest/Data load via `AppFace` channel pairs
  across `--concurrency` workers, and reports throughput and latency percentiles (p50/p95/p99).

#### `ndn-engine` — Layer 1 forwarding engine

- **`Fib` / `FibEntry` / `FibNexthop`** — engine-layer FIB wrapping `NameTrie<Arc<FibEntry>>`.
  Uses `FaceId` (not `u32`) directly. `add_nexthop` upserts by face; `remove_nexthop` removes
  the entry entirely when the last nexthop is removed.

- **`ForwarderEngine`** — `Arc<EngineInner>` handle. Cheaply cloneable; clones share the same
  FIB, PIT, and `FaceTable`. Exposes `fib()`, `pit()`, `faces()` accessors.

- **`EngineBuilder` / `EngineConfig`** — constructs and wires the engine. `face<F: Face>` adds
  pre-configured faces before startup. `build()` spawns the PIT expiry task and returns
  `(ForwarderEngine, ShutdownHandle)`.

- **`ShutdownHandle`** — `CancellationToken` + `JoinSet<()>`. `shutdown()` cancels all engine
  tasks and joins them, logging any panics at `WARN` level.

- **`run_expiry_task`** — background task that drains expired PIT entries every millisecond.
  Exits cleanly on `CancellationToken` cancellation.

#### `ndn-app` — Layer 1 application API

- **`AppFace::new(face_id, capacity) -> (AppFace, Receiver<OutboundRequest>)`** — factory that
  creates the application-side face and the engine-side request receiver as a linked pair.

- **`OutboundRequest`** — `pub` enum (`Interest { interest, reply }` and
  `RegisterPrefix { prefix, handler }`) that flows from `AppFace` to the engine runner over
  `mpsc`. Made public so the engine can match on received requests.

- **`AppError`** — `Timeout`, `Nacked { reason }`, `Engine(anyhow::Error)`.

#### `ndn-ipc` — Layer 1 IPC utilities

- **`ChunkedProducer`** — segments an arbitrary `Bytes` payload into fixed-size chunks
  (`NDN_DEFAULT_SEGMENT_SIZE = 8192`). `segment(index)` returns individual chunks for
  prefix-registered Data production; `segment_count()` supplies FinalBlockId.

- **`ChunkedConsumer`** — reassembles out-of-order segments by index. `receive_segment(i, data)`
  stores each chunk; `is_complete()` and `reassemble()` drive the consumer state machine.

- **`IpcClient`** — wraps `Arc<AppFace>` with a namespace `Name` for ergonomic Interest
  expression.

- **`IpcServer`** — wraps `Arc<AppFace>` with a prefix `Name` for handler registration.

- **`ServiceRegistry`** — in-memory service registry keyed by name string. `register`,
  `lookup`, `unregister`, `service_count`. Mirrors the `/local/services/<name>/info` namespace
  pattern for single-process deployments.

#### `ndn-store` — Layer 4 data structures

- **`NameTrie::first_descendant(prefix: &Name) -> Option<V>`** — depth-first
  search from a prefix node to find any value stored at or below that position.
  Used by `LruCs` for `CanBePrefix` lookups.

- **`Fib` / `FibEntry` / `FibNexthop`** — Forwarding Information Base wrapping
  `NameTrie<Arc<FibEntry>>`. Exposes `lpm`, `get`, `insert`, `add_nexthop`, and
  `remove`. Uses `u32` for `face_id` (consistent with `PIT`) to avoid a
  same-layer cross-dependency on `ndn-transport`.

- **`StrategyTable<S>`** — generic newtype over `NameTrie<Arc<S>>` for
  longest-prefix strategy dispatch. Decoupled from the concrete `Strategy` trait
  (defined in `ndn-strategy`) so it can live in the foundational store layer.

- **`ShardedCs<C: ContentStore>`** — shards any `ContentStore` across `N`
  instances. Shard selection is by first name component so that related content
  (`/video/seg/1`, `/video/seg/2`) lands in the same shard, preserving LRU
  locality for sequential access patterns. `capacity()` aggregates all shards.

#### `ndn-store` — `LruCs` improvements

- **`CanBePrefix` support** — `LruInner` now carries a
  `prefix_index: NameTrie<Arc<Name>>` secondary index. Every insert adds the
  name to the trie; every eviction (explicit or LRU-triggered) removes it.
  `get()` uses `first_descendant` for `CanBePrefix` interests.

- **Fixed linear-scan evict bug** — `evict()` previously did an O(n) scan to
  reconstruct an `Arc<Name>` key. It now calls `cache.pop(name: &Name)` directly
  via `Arc<Name>: Borrow<Name>`.

- **Fixed entry-count limit** — the `LruCache` cap was `capacity_bytes / 64`
  (minimum 1), which starved small capacities of entries before byte-based
  eviction could kick in. Changed to `capacity_bytes.max(1)` so the byte loop
  is always the sole eviction control.

#### `ndn-transport` — Layer 4 transport utilities

- **`TlvCodec`** — `tokio_util::codec` `Decoder` / `Encoder` for NDN TLV stream
  framing. Handles all `varu64` type and length widths. Used by `TcpFace`,
  `UnixFace`, and `SerialFace` (implemented in Layer 3 face crates).

- **`FacePairTable`** — `DashMap`-backed rx→tx `FaceId` mapping for asymmetric
  wfb-ng links. The dispatch stage calls `get_tx_for_rx(in_face).unwrap_or(in_face)`
  so symmetric faces (no table entry) fall through unchanged.

- **`FaceEvent`** — `Opened(FaceId)` / `Closed(FaceId)` lifecycle events.
  Face tasks emit `Closed` when `recv()` returns `FaceError::Closed`; the face
  manager uses this to clean up PIT `OutRecord` entries.

#### `ndn-pipeline` — Layer 2 packet pipeline

- **`PipelineStage` trait** — `async fn process(&self, ctx: PacketContext) -> Result<Action, DropReason>` with `BoxedStage` alias for dynamic dispatch.
- **`PacketContext`** — per-packet value type carrying raw bytes, face ID, decoded name, decoded packet, PIT token, out-face list, cs_hit / verified flags, arrival timestamp, and a typed `AnyMap` escape hatch for inter-stage communication.
- **`Action`** — ownership-based enum (`Continue`, `Send`, `Satisfy`, `Drop`, `Nack`). Returning `Continue` hands the context to the next stage; all other variants consume it — use-after-hand-off is a compile error.
- **`ForwardingAction`** — strategy return type (`Forward`, `ForwardAfter`, `Nack`, `Suppress`). `ForwardAfter` carries a `Duration` for probe-and-fallback scheduling.
- **`DropReason` / `NackReason`** — typed enums, not stringly-typed codes.

#### `ndn-strategy` — Layer 2 forwarding strategies

- **`Strategy` trait** — `after_receive_interest`, `after_receive_data`, `on_interest_timeout`, `on_nack` (last two default to `Suppress`). Returns `SmallVec<[ForwardingAction; 2]>` — two actions inline for probe-and-fallback without allocation.
- **`StrategyContext`** — immutable view of engine state (`name`, `in_face`, `fib_entry`, `pit_token`, `measurements`). Strategies cannot mutate forwarding tables directly.
- **`FibEntry` / `FibNexthop`** — local strategy-layer types using `FaceId` (not `u32`) to allow direct face dispatch without cross-layer dependency confusion.
- **`BestRouteStrategy`** — lowest-cost nexthop, split-horizon (`nexthops_excluding(in_face)`). Falls back to `Nack(NoRoute)` when no nexthop exists.
- **`MulticastStrategy`** — fans Interest to all nexthops except the incoming face. Returns all face IDs in a single `Forward` action.
- **`MeasurementsTable`** — `DashMap`-backed EWMA RTT and satisfaction rate per (prefix, face). Updated before strategy call so strategies read fresh RTT. `EwmaRtt::rto_ns()` = srtt + 4×rttvar.

#### `ndn-security` — Layer 2 security

- **`Signer` / `Ed25519Signer`** — `BoxFuture`-based async signing (enables `Arc<dyn Signer>` storage). `Ed25519Signer::from_seed(&[u8; 32], key_name)` for deterministic construction.
- **`Verifier` / `Ed25519Verifier` / `VerifyOutcome`** — `Invalid` is `Ok(VerifyOutcome::Invalid)` not `Err`, since a bad signature is an expected outcome, not an exception.
- **`TrustSchema` / `NamePattern` / `PatternComponent`** — rule-based data-name / key-name pattern matching with named capture groups. `Capture` binds one component; `MultiCapture` consumes trailing components. Captured variables must be consistent between data and key patterns.
- **`CertCache`** — `DashMap`-backed in-memory certificate cache. Certificates are named Data packets fetched via Interest.
- **`KeyStore` trait / `MemKeyStore`** — async key store trait; `MemKeyStore` for testing.
- **`SafeData`** — wraps `Data` + `TrustPath` + `verified_at`. `pub(crate)` constructors prevent application code from bypassing verification.
- **`Validator`** — schema check → cert cache lookup → cryptographic verification. Returns `Valid(SafeData)`, `Invalid(TrustError)`, or `Pending` (cert not yet cached). Exposes `cert_cache()` accessor for pre-population in tests.

#### `ndn-face-net` — Layer 3 network faces

- **`UdpFace`** — unicast UDP face. The socket is `connect()`-ed to the peer at
  construction, so the kernel filters inbound datagrams. `from_socket` wraps a
  pre-configured socket; `bind` creates and connects one atomically.

- **`TcpFace`** — TCP face with `TlvCodec` stream framing. Stream is split into
  `FramedRead` / `FramedWrite` halves, each behind a `tokio::sync::Mutex`.
  `from_stream` wraps an accepted stream; `connect` opens a new connection.

- **`MulticastUdpFace`** — NDN IPv4 multicast face. Publishes `NDN_MULTICAST_V4`
  (`224.0.23.170`) and `NDN_PORT` (`6363`) constants. `recv` captures datagrams
  from any sender (neighbor discovery); `send` multicasts to the group. The
  multicast loopback roundtrip test is best-effort and skips gracefully in
  sandboxed CI environments.

#### `ndn-engine` — Pipeline dispatcher (new)

- **`TlvDecodeStage`** — decodes `ctx.raw_bytes` into `DecodedPacket::Interest`,
  `Data`, or `Nack`; sets `ctx.packet` and `ctx.name`. Returns
  `Action::Drop(MalformedPacket)` on any parse failure.

- **`CsLookupStage`** — CS hit path: inserts `CsEntry` into `ctx.tags`, sets
  `ctx.cs_hit`, appends `ctx.face_id` to `ctx.out_faces`, and returns
  `Action::Satisfy` — bypassing PIT/FIB entirely. Miss path returns
  `Action::Continue`.

- **`CsInsertStage`** — stores received Data in the CS after PIT fan-back.
  Derives `stale_at` from `MetaInfo::freshness_period`; defaults to immediately
  stale when absent.

- **`PitCheckStage`** — Interest path: detects loop (nonce already in
  `nonces_seen` → `Drop(LoopDetected)`), aggregates (existing PIT entry, new
  in-record → `Drop(Suppressed)`), or creates a new entry and continues to the
  strategy stage.

- **`PitMatchStage`** — Data path: removes PIT entry, populates `ctx.out_faces`
  from `in_record_faces()`, returns `Drop(Other)` for unsolicited Data.

- **`ErasedStrategy`** — object-safe wrapper over the `impl Future`-based
  `Strategy` trait. Blanket impl boxes the strategy future so the stage can be
  stored as `Arc<dyn ErasedStrategy>`.

- **`StrategyStage`** — converts engine `FibEntry` → strategy `FibEntry`,
  builds `StrategyContext`, calls `ErasedStrategy::after_receive_interest_erased`,
  and translates `ForwardingAction` into `Action`. `ForwardAfter` forwards
  immediately (delay scheduling not yet implemented).

- **`PacketDispatcher`** — owns all stages and the face table. `spawn()` creates
  a bounded `mpsc` channel, starts one reader task per registered face, and runs
  the pipeline runner. The runner spawns a Tokio task per packet for parallel
  processing. Interest path: decode → CS lookup → PIT check → strategy → send.
  Data path: decode → PIT match → CS insert → satisfy.

- **`run_face_reader`** — async loop calling `ErasedFace::recv_bytes()`,
  wrapping results into `InboundPacket`, and forwarding to the pipeline channel.
  Exits cleanly on `FaceError::Closed` or `CancellationToken`.

- **`ErasedFace::recv_bytes()`** added to `ndn-transport::FaceTable` —
  object-safe boxed future wrapping `Face::recv()`, allowing the dispatcher to
  read from any face stored in the `FaceTable` without knowing its concrete type.

- **`EngineInner`** extended with `cs: Arc<LruCs>` and
  `measurements: Arc<MeasurementsTable>`; `ForwarderEngine` exposes `cs()` accessor.

- **`EngineBuilder::build()`** now wires all stages, constructs `PacketDispatcher`,
  and spawns it. `EngineBuilder::strategy<S: ErasedStrategy>` overrides the
  default `BestRouteStrategy`.

#### `ndn-security` — `SecurityManager` (new)

- **`SecurityManager`** — high-level orchestrator over `MemKeyStore` and
  `CertCache`. Operations:
  - `generate_ed25519(key_name)` — generates an Ed25519 key pair and stores it.
  - `generate_ed25519_from_seed(key_name, &[u8; 32])` — deterministic variant for testing.
  - `issue_self_signed(key_name, public_key_bytes, validity_ms)` — creates a
    `Certificate`, inserts it into both the cert cache and the trust-anchor set.
  - `certify(subject_key_name, public_key, issuer_key_name, validity_ms)` —
    issues a CA-signed certificate (full TLV cert encoding deferred).
  - `add_trust_anchor(cert)` — registers a pre-existing cert as implicitly trusted.
  - `trust_anchor(key_name)` / `trust_anchor_names()` — anchor lookup.
  - `get_signer(key_name)` — delegates to the key store.
  - `cert_cache()` — exposes the cache for passing to `Validator`.

#### `ndn-config` — new crate (Layer 1)

- **`ForwarderConfig`** — TOML-serialisable top-level config struct. Parsed with
  `from_str(s)` or `from_file(path)`; round-tripped with `to_toml_string()`.

  Fields:
  - `[engine]` → `EngineConfig { cs_capacity_mb, pipeline_channel_cap }` (defaults: 64 MB, 1024).
  - `[[face]]` → `FaceConfig { kind, bind?, remote?, group?, port?, interface?, path? }`.
    `kind` is one of `"udp"`, `"tcp"`, `"multicast"`, `"unix"`.
  - `[[route]]` → `RouteConfig { prefix, face, cost }` (`cost` defaults to 10).
  - `[security]` → `SecurityConfig { trust_anchor?, key_dir?, require_signed }`.

- **`ManagementRequest`** / **`ManagementResponse`** — JSON-tagged enums for the
  Unix-socket management protocol. Commands: `add_route`, `remove_route`,
  `list_routes`, `list_faces`, `get_stats`, `shutdown`. Responses: `Ok`,
  `OkData { data }`, `Error { message }`.

- **`ManagementServer`** — holds the socket path; `decode_request(line)` and
  `encode_response(resp)` handle newline-delimited JSON serialisation.

#### `ndn-router` — config and management wiring

- Accepts `-c <path>` to load a `ForwarderConfig` TOML file; uses defaults when
  omitted.
- Applies `[[route]]` entries from the config to the live FIB at startup.
- Spawns a Unix-socket management server (`-m <path>`, default
  `/tmp/ndn-router.sock`) that handles `ManagementRequest` JSON commands: route
  add/remove are reflected into the engine FIB immediately; `get_stats` returns
  live PIT size; `list_faces` enumerates registered face IDs; `shutdown` fires the
  `CancellationToken`.

#### `ndn-face-local` — Layer 3 local faces

- **`UnixFace`** — Unix domain socket face with `TlvCodec` framing. Same
  `FramedRead`/`FramedWrite` + `Mutex` design as `TcpFace`. `connect` opens a
  new connection; `from_stream` wraps an accepted stream. Carries the socket path
  for diagnostics. Tests use a `process::id() + AtomicU64` counter for socket
  paths (replacing `subsec_nanos()`) to prevent path collisions between parallel
  tests, and `loopback_pair` is guarded by a 5-second timeout so a mis-bound
  listener never causes a silent hang.

- **`AppFace` / `AppHandle`** — in-process face backed by a pair of
  `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels. `AppFace::new(id, buffer)` returns both halves.
  The pipeline holds `AppFace`; the application holds `AppHandle`. Drop either
  side to signal closure (`FaceError::Closed` / `None`).

### Investigated and rejected

#### Multi-threaded pipeline dispatcher

Prototyped three `EngineConfig` knobs for parallelising the pipeline:

- **`pipeline_runners`** — N tasks sharing the inbound `mpsc::Receiver` via
  `Arc<Mutex<Receiver>>`, each competing to drain packets.
- **`max_concurrent_packets`** — `tokio::sync::Semaphore` gating in-flight
  `process_packet` spawns (0 = unlimited).
- **`pit_shards`** — `Pit::with_shard_amount(n)` passed through to
  `DashMap::with_shard_amount`.

Benchmarked 1000-packet batches through the full dispatcher (AppFace →
decode → CS miss → PIT → strategy Nack → fan-back) on a 4-thread Tokio
runtime:

| Config | Throughput | Time / 1000 pkts |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 runner, unlimited | **668 Kpps** | 1.50 ms |
| 1 runner, 512 limit | **708 Kpps** | 1.41 ms |
| 2 runners, unlimited | 380 Kpps | 2.63 ms |
| 4 runners, unlimited | 340 Kpps | 2.94 ms |
| 4 runners, 512 limit | 335 Kpps | 2.97 ms |

**Conclusion:** The pipeline bottleneck is not the single runner's
`recv → spawn` loop — it's the per-packet decode/PIT/strategy work, which
already runs in parallel via `tokio::spawn`. Adding multiple runners only
adds `Arc<Mutex<Receiver>>` contention (≈2× slower). The semaphore had
negligible overhead and marginally improved throughput by bounding scheduler
pressure, but the benefit is too small to justify the complexity.

All three knobs reverted. The single-runner, unlimited-spawn design remains
the default. If a future workload (e.g., per-packet crypto verification)
makes the runner loop itself the bottleneck, this can be revisited.

## [Unreleased — SPSC futex / pipe wakeup]

### Changed

#### `ndn-face-local` — platform-native wakeup replaces `UnixDatagram`

The per-packet wakeup mechanism in `SpscFace` / `SpscHandle` now uses the
fastest primitive available on each platform.  The parked-flag protocol
(SeqCst store → second ring check → sleep) is unchanged; only the
sleep/wake primitive changes.

**Linux — futex via `atomic-wait`**

`atomic_wait::wait(parked, 1)` blocks the OS thread while `parked == 1`;
the producer calls `atomic_wait::wake_one(parked)` to unblock.  The futex
syscall keys on the physical SHM page offset, so it works cross-process
without any additional file descriptor.  The wait runs inside
`tokio::task::spawn_blocking` to keep the async executor responsive.

**macOS / other Unix — named FIFO pair**

`SpscFace::create` creates two named FIFOs
(`/tmp/.ndn-{name}.a2e.pipe`, `.e2a.pipe`) and opens them with
`O_RDWR | O_NONBLOCK` (avoids the blocking-open problem: neither side
needs to wait for the other to open).  The consumer awaits readability via
`tokio::io::unix::AsyncFd` (backed by kqueue); the producer writes 1 byte
via a direct non-blocking `libc::write`.  Silently ignores `EAGAIN` on the
write — if the pipe buffer is full the consumer already has a pending
wakeup.

**Removed**: `tokio::net::UnixDatagram` fields (`sock`, `sock_path`,
`app_path` / `eng_path`) from both `SpscFace` and `SpscHandle`.  On Linux
those structs now carry **no extra fields** beyond the SHM region.

#### Dependency

- `atomic-wait = "1"` added to workspace dependencies and to the
  `ndn-face-local` `spsc-shm` feature (`spsc-shm = ["dep:libc",
  "dep:atomic-wait"]`).  The crate is compiled on all platforms but its
  symbols are only referenced under `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`.

#### Tests

All four `shm::spsc` tests updated to
`#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread", worker_threads = 2)]` — required
because `spawn_blocking` panics in a `current_thread` runtime.
`rt-multi-thread` added to `ndn-face-local` dev-dependency tokio features.

## [Unreleased — SPSC parked-flag optimization, iceoryx2 bridge redesign]

### Removed

- **`iceoryx2` dependency dropped** — removed from the entire workspace.
  `SpscFace` with the parked-flag optimization is now the sole SHM backend and
  is faster in every measured dimension.  The removed code:
  - `crates/ndn-face-local/src/shm/iox2.rs` — `Iox2Face` / `Iox2Handle`
  - `iceoryx2-shm` Cargo feature in `ndn-face-local`
  - `iceoryx2-mgmt` Cargo feature in `ndn-router` and `ndn-tools`
  - `binaries/ndn-router/src/mgmt_ipc.rs` — iceoryx2 management server
  - `iceoryx2` bypass path in `ndn-tools/src/ctl.rs`
  - `iceoryx2 = "0.8.1"` workspace dependency

  `ShmFace` / `ShmHandle` type aliases in `shm/mod.rs` now always resolve to
  `SpscFace` / `SpscHandle`.  The bypass management transport in `ndn-router`
  and `ndn-ctl` retains its Unix-socket path; the iceoryx2 bypass path is gone.

### Changed

#### `ndn-face-local` — SPSC parked-flag wakeup optimization

Eliminated per-packet wakeup syscalls during bursts by adding two atomic
parked-flag fields to the SHM header.

**Protocol** (SeqCst total-order fence prevents the ABA race):
1. Consumer sets `parked = 1` with `SeqCst` store.
2. Consumer re-checks the ring; if non-empty, clears the flag and returns.
3. Consumer sleeps on `UnixDatagram::recv`.
4. Producer checks `parked` with `SeqCst` load; sends wakeup datagram only if
   non-zero.

**Header layout change** — two new cache-line-aligned fields extend the header
from 5 to 7 cache lines (320 → 448 bytes):

| Cache line | Contents |
|-----------|---------|
| 0 | magic, capacity, slot\_size |
| 1 | a2e head/tail ring indices |
| 2 | e2a head/tail ring indices |
| 3 | (reserved padding) |
| 4 | (reserved padding) |
| 5 | `a2e_parked` flag (engine / a2e consumer) |
| 6 | `e2a_parked` flag (app / e2a consumer) |

#### `ndn-face-local` — iceoryx2 bridge redesign

Replaced the WaitSet + event-service design (which hung on macOS during
benchmarks) with a simpler `recv_timeout` poll:

- Bridge threads sleep on `std::sync::mpsc::Receiver::recv_timeout(200 µs)`.
- Tokio send path immediately wakes the bridge via `SyncSender<()>::try_send`
  stored as `KickFn = Box<dyn Fn() + Send + Sync + 'static>`.
- `ipc::Service` (single-threaded) replaces `ipc_threadsafe::Service`; the kick
  channel is `Send + Sync` so no thread-safety upgrade is needed.
- Fixed `ZeroCopySend` derive: added `use iceoryx2::prelude::ZeroCopySend;` so
  the plain `#[derive(ZeroCopySend)]` compiles without the path-qualified form.
- Fixed `ServiceName::try_into`: iceoryx2 implements `TryFrom<&str>` not
  `TryFrom<String>`; helper fns now call `.as_str().try_into()`.
- Benchmark fixed to reuse a single service pair across all payload sizes, avoiding
  iceoryx2 node-registry exhaustion on macOS when pairs are rapidly created and
  torn down.

### Benchmark results (macOS, release build, after SPSC parked-flag optimization)

Run: `cargo bench -p ndn-face-local --features spsc-shm,iceoryx2-shm`

| Benchmark | p50 latency / throughput | vs. before | Notes |

**Key findings after SPSC optimization:**

- `SpscFace` now beats `UnixFace` latency by **17×** at 64 B (124 ns vs 2.10 µs)
  and is on par with `AppFace` (142 ns) at small sizes.  The wakeup datagram cost
  was entirely dominating before; it is now paid only when the consumer genuinely
  sleeps between packets.

- `SpscFace` throughput leaps from sub-`UnixFace` to **14× faster** at 64 B
  (34.4 Mpkt/s vs 2.53 Mpkt/s), making it the fastest transport for burst traffic.

- At 8 192 B the `memcpy` into the fixed SHM slot (65 520 bytes per slot)
  begins to appear, but latency is still 10× better than before optimization
  and 10× better than `UnixFace`.

- `AppFace` and `UnixFace` numbers are stable within noise (< 2 % variance),
  confirming no regression in those paths.

## [Unreleased — NDN management, face lifecycle, SHM faces, benchmarks]

### Added

#### `ndn-router` — NDN-native management transport

- **NDN management over Interest/Data** (`mgmt_ndn` module) — replaces the
  bootstrap-only Unix-socket bypass as the primary management path.
  - `run_ndn_mgmt_handler` — async task that receives `Interest` packets from an
    `AppHandle`, decodes the `ApplicationParameters` TLV payload as JSON
    `ManagementRequest`, dispatches via `handle_request`, and writes the
    `ManagementResponse` back as a `Data` packet.
  - `run_face_listener` — async task that binds a `UnixFace` listener at the
    path configured in `[management].face_socket`; for each accepted connection
    it calls `ForwarderEngine::add_face` so the face participates in normal
    forwarding.
  - `mgmt_prefix()` — returns `/localhost/ndn-ctl` as a `Name`.
  - The management `AppFace` is pre-registered with the `EngineBuilder` (FaceId
    `0xFFFF_0001`) and its prefix `/localhost/ndn-ctl/…` is installed in the FIB
    before startup so management Interests are routed without any special-casing
    in the pipeline.
- **Transport selection** — `[management].transport = "ndn"` (default) activates
  NDN-over-face; `"bypass"` falls back to the Unix-socket or iceoryx2 path.
- **`ndn_face_local::AppFace` / `AppHandle`** used throughout — `ndn_app::AppFace`
  does not implement the `Face` trait and cannot be registered with the engine;
  all engine-adjacent code was updated to use `ndn_face_local`.

#### `ndn-config` — management config extended

- Added `[management]` section with `transport` (default `"ndn"`),
  `face_socket` (Unix socket path for NDN face listener), and `bypass_socket`
  (path for raw JSON bypass socket).

#### `ndn-tools` — `ndn-ctl` NDN transport

- `ndn-ctl` now sends management commands as NDN Interests over a `UnixFace`
  connection to the router's face listener (default `/tmp/ndn-face.sock`).
  `ApplicationParameters` TLV carries the JSON request; the first Data packet
  back is decoded as the JSON response.  The iceoryx2 path is preserved when the
  `iceoryx2-mgmt` feature is enabled.
- Added missing `ndn-face-local` and `ndn-transport` workspace dependencies to
  `binaries/ndn-tools/Cargo.toml`.

#### `ndn-store` — `NameTrie::dump`

- **`NameTrie::dump() -> Vec<(Name, V)>`** — depth-first traversal of the entire
  trie returning all stored entries as `(Name, value)` pairs.  Releases each
  node's `RwLock` before recursing into children to avoid deadlock on the
  concurrent trie.

#### `ndn-engine` — `Fib::dump`

- **`Fib::dump() -> Vec<(Name, Arc<FibEntry>)>`** — delegates to
  `NameTrie::dump()` so the management handler can serialise the full FIB.

#### `ndn-transport` — face table improvements

- **`FaceTable::face_entries() -> Vec<(FaceId, FaceKind)>`** — returns all
  registered faces with their kind, used by `list-faces` to show human-readable
  face types instead of raw IDs.
- **`ErasedFace::kind()`** — `kind()` method added to the object-safe
  `ErasedFace` trait (and its blanket `impl<F: Face> ErasedFace for F`) so the
  face table can expose kind without knowing the concrete type.
- **Face ID recycling** — `FaceTable` now holds a `Mutex<Vec<u32>>` free list.
  `alloc_id()` pops from the free list before bumping the atomic counter, so IDs
  are reused after face teardown instead of monotonically growing.
- **Reserved ID range** — `RESERVED_FACE_ID_MIN = 0xFFFF_0000`; IDs at or above
  this value are never allocated by `alloc_id()` and are never added to the free
  list.  The management `AppFace` uses `0xFFFF_0001`.

#### `ndn-transport` — `FaceKind::Shm`

- New variant `FaceKind::Shm` for shared-memory faces.  Appears in
  `list-faces` output; treated as a transient face (auto-removed from the table
  when the reader exits).

#### `ndn-engine` — face lifecycle

- **Auto-removal of transient faces** — `run_face_reader` now accepts
  `face_table: Arc<FaceTable>` and removes the face from the table when the
  reader loop exits (face closed or cancelled).  `App` and `Internal` kind faces
  are exempt — they are long-lived engine objects.
- `PacketDispatcher::spawn` and `ForwarderEngine::add_face` both pass the face
  table to `run_face_reader`.

#### `ndn-router` — `list-faces` and `list-routes` management commands

- `list-faces` now returns `{"faces": [{"id": N, "kind": "unix"}, …]}` (rich
  kind information, filtered to exclude internal `App`/`Internal` faces).
- `list-routes` now returns `{"routes": [{"prefix": "/ndn", "nexthops":
  [{"face": 1, "cost": 10}]}, …]}` via the new `Fib::dump` traversal.

#### `ndn-face-local` — SHM faces (`spsc-shm` / `iceoryx2-shm` features)

- **`SpscFace` / `SpscHandle`** (`spsc-shm` feature, Unix only) — custom
  lock-free SPSC ring buffer in POSIX SHM.  Two rings (a2e, e2a) share a
  5-cache-line header (`magic u64 | capacity u32 | slot_size u32 | 4×AtomicU32
  ring indices`).  Wakeup notifications use a pair of `tokio::net::UnixDatagram`
  sockets at `/tmp/.ndn-{name}.{e,a}.sock`.  `SpscFace::create[_with]` sets up
  the engine side; `SpscHandle::connect` does a two-phase open (header-only first
  to read ring parameters, then full mapping).

- **`Iox2Face` / `Iox2Handle`** (`iceoryx2-shm` feature) — iceoryx2 pub-sub
  backend.  Two services per face (`ndn-shm/{name}/a2e` app→engine,
  `ndn-shm/{name}/e2a` engine→app).  Background OS threads bridge the blocking
  iceoryx2 API to `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels used by the async
  `Face::send`/`Face::recv` methods.  `NdnPacket` is `#[repr(C)] ZeroCopySend`
  with a 65 520-byte payload area.

- **Type aliases** in `shm/mod.rs` dispatch to the active backend:
  `ShmFace = Iox2Face` when `iceoryx2-shm` is enabled, else `SpscFace`.  Same
  for `ShmHandle`.  Both concrete types remain directly importable.

- **Public API**:
  ```rust
  // Engine process
  let face = ShmFace::create(FaceId(5), "my-app")?;
  engine.add_face(face, cancel);

  // Application process
  let handle = ShmHandle::connect("my-app")?;
  handle.send(interest_bytes).await?;
  let data = handle.recv().await?;
  ```

#### `ndn-face-local` — benchmarks

- **`benches/face_local.rs`** — Criterion benchmark suite comparing all four
  in-process face implementations across latency and throughput at packet sizes
  64 B, 1 024 B, 8 192 B:

  | Group | What is measured |
  |-------|-----------------|
  | `appface/latency` | One mpsc round-trip (app→face→app) |
  | `appface/throughput` | 1 000-packet burst, one direction |
  | `unix/latency` | One socketpair round-trip with TLV codec |
  | `unix/throughput` | 200-packet burst, concurrent send+recv |
  | `spsc/latency` | One SHM ring round-trip including Unix-datagram wakeup |
  | `spsc/throughput` | 32-packet burst (half ring capacity), one direction |
  | `iox2/latency` | One iceoryx2 round-trip through OS-thread bridge |
  | `iox2/throughput` | 100-packet burst through OS-thread bridge |

  `unix/latency` uses `tokio::net::UnixStream::pair()` (kernel `socketpair`) so
  no socket file is written to disk.  Both `unix/latency` and `unix/throughput`
  use `tokio::join!` to run send and recv concurrently; sequential execution
  deadlocks for 8 192 B packets because macOS's default Unix socket buffer is
  exactly 8 192 bytes.

  Run with: `cargo bench -p ndn-face-local --features spsc-shm,iceoryx2-shm`

### Fixed

- **`ndn_app::AppFace` / `ndn_face_local::AppFace` confusion** — `ndn_app::AppFace`
  provides a higher-level application API and does not implement the
  `ndn_transport::Face` trait.  `ndn_face_local::AppFace` does implement `Face`
  and is the correct type to register with the engine.  All engine-adjacent code
  (`ndn-router`, `ndn-ipc` tests) updated to use `ndn_face_local`.

### Benchmark results (macOS, release build)

| Benchmark | p50 latency / throughput | Notes |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------|
| `appface/latency/64` | 143 ns | |
| `appface/latency/1024` | 144 ns | |
| `appface/latency/8192` | 145 ns | |
| `appface/throughput/64` | 2.81 Mpkt/s | |
| `appface/throughput/1024` | 2.82 Mpkt/s | |
| `appface/throughput/8192` | 2.83 Mpkt/s | |
| `unix/latency/64` | 2.07 µs | socketpair, TLV framing |
| `unix/latency/1024` | 2.26 µs | |
| `unix/latency/8192` | 6.78 µs | crosses 8 KiB socket buffer |
| `unix/throughput/64` | 2.65 Mpkt/s | |
| `unix/throughput/1024` | 1.55 Mpkt/s | |
| `unix/throughput/8192` | 409 Kpkt/s | |
| `spsc/latency/64` | 2.57 µs | wakeup datagram dominates |
| `spsc/latency/1024` | 2.69 µs | |
| `spsc/latency/8192` | 3.41 µs | |
| `spsc/throughput/64` | 810 Kpkt/s | 32-pkt burst |
| `spsc/throughput/1024` | 776 Kpkt/s | |
| `spsc/throughput/8192` | 645 Kpkt/s | |

**Key findings:**

- `AppFace` is ~15–18× lower latency than any kernel-mediated face because mpsc
  never enters the kernel.  Packet size has almost no effect since only a pointer
  is transferred.

- `SpscFace` latency (~2.6 µs small packets) is comparable to `UnixFace`
  (~2.1 µs) despite the lock-free ring, because every packet still triggers two
  `sendmsg`/`recvmsg` wakeup calls — one per direction.  The ring copy
  (`memcpy` into a 8 960-byte slot) adds overhead at 8 192 B but stays below
  `UnixFace`'s 6.78 µs for that size.

- `UnixFace` throughput degrades sharply at 8 192 B (409 Kpkt/s vs 2.65 Mpkt/s
  at 64 B) because each packet crosses the 8 KiB socket buffer boundary,
  requiring the kernel to schedule both endpoints cooperatively (visible as a
  3× latency jump from 1 024 B to 8 192 B).

- `SpscFace` throughput (one `sendmsg` per packet even in burst mode) is ~3–6×
  lower than `UnixFace` throughput at small sizes because `UnixFace` benefits
  from TCP-Nagle-like coalescing at the stream level, while the datagram wakeup
  socket sends one 1-byte datagram per packet.

- The `iceoryx2` backend is not benchmarked here because its OS-thread bridge
  polls on a 1 ms cycle; round-trip latency would be ~2 ms and is not
  competitive for single-packet exchanges.  It may be added once the bridge is
  switched to an event-driven wakeup.

### Tests added

## [Unreleased — security tooling, PIB, iceoryx2 management]

### Added

#### `ndn-security` — persistent PIB backend

- **`FilePib`** — file-based Public Info Base. Directory layout:
  `<root>/keys/<sha256>/private.key` + `cert.ndnc` for identity keys/certs;
  `<root>/anchors/<sha256>/cert.ndnc` for trust anchors.
  SHA-256 of canonical name bytes used as directory name to avoid filesystem
  special-character issues.
  Operations:
  - `new(root)` / `open(root)` — create or open a PIB directory.
  - `generate_ed25519(name)` — creates a key pair with `ring::rand::SystemRandom`
    (real CSPRNG) and persists the 32-byte seed.
  - `get_signer(name)` / `delete_key(name)` / `list_keys()` — key CRUD.
  - `store_cert(cert)` / `get_cert(name)` — certificate CRUD.
  - `add_trust_anchor(cert)` / `remove_trust_anchor(name)` / `trust_anchors()` /
    `list_anchors()` — trust anchor management.
  - `name_to_uri(name)` / `name_from_uri(uri)` — percent-encoded NDN URI helpers
    (public; reused by `ndn-sec` CLI).

- **NDNC certificate binary format** — compact format used for on-disk storage:
  `[4] magic "NDNC" | [1] version=1 | [8] valid_from (u64 BE ns) |
  [8] valid_until (u64 BE ns) | [4] pk_len (u32 BE) | [pk_len] public key bytes`.

- **`PibError`** — `Io`, `KeyNotFound`, `CertNotFound`, `Corrupt`, `InvalidName`
  variants; `From<PibError> for TrustError` for ergonomic `?` propagation.

- **`Ed25519Signer::public_key_bytes() -> [u8; 32]`** — exposes the verifying key
  bytes needed to embed a public key in a self-signed certificate.

#### `ndn-security` — `SecurityManager` updates

- **`SecurityManager::generate_ed25519()`** now uses `ring::rand::SystemRandom`
  for a real CSPRNG instead of the previous deterministic placeholder seed.

- **`SecurityManager::from_pib(pib, identity)`** — constructs a `SecurityManager`
  pre-loaded with the given identity's signer, its certificate (if present), and
  all trust anchors from the PIB.

#### `ndn-config` — `SecurityConfig` expanded

- Added `identity: Option<String>` — NDN URI of the router's identity
  (e.g. `"/ndn/router1"`); loaded from the PIB at startup.
- Added `pib_path: Option<String>` — PIB directory path; defaults to
  `~/.ndn/pib` when absent.

#### `ndn-tools` — `ndn-ctl` management client

- New binary `ndn-ctl` for sending management commands to a running `ndn-router`.
  Transport is selected at compile time via the `iceoryx2-mgmt` feature (mirrors
  the same flag on `ndn-router`):

  | Build                              | Transport                   |
  |------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
  | default (Unix targets)             | Unix domain socket          |
  | `--features iceoryx2-mgmt`         | iceoryx2 shared-memory RPC  |

  Global flags:
  - `--socket <path>` (env `$NDN_MGMT_SOCK`, default `/tmp/ndn-router.sock`) — Unix socket transport.
  - `--service <name>` (env `$NDN_MGMT_SERVICE`, default `ndn/router/mgmt`) — iceoryx2 transport.

  Subcommands:
  | Command | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | `add-route <prefix> --face <n> [--cost <n>]` | Add or update a FIB route. |
  | `remove-route <prefix> --face <n>` | Remove a FIB nexthop. |
  | `list-routes` | List FIB routes. |
  | `list-faces` | List registered face IDs. |
  | `get-stats` | Print engine statistics (PIT size). |
  | `shutdown` | Request a graceful router shutdown. |

  The iceoryx2 client defines local `MgmtReq`/`MgmtResp` wire types (identical
  layout to the server's) and polls for a response with a 5-second timeout.

#### `ndn-tools` — `ndn-sec` CLI binary

- New binary `ndn-sec` for offline key and certificate management.
  Global flag: `--pib <path>` (also reads `$NDN_PIB`; falls back to `~/.ndn/pib`).

  Subcommands:
  | Command | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | `keygen <name>` | Generate an Ed25519 key + self-signed cert. `--anchor` registers the cert as a trust anchor; `--days N` sets validity (default 365). |
  | `certdump <name>` | Pretty-print the stored certificate (subject, issuer, public key hex, validity). |
  | `list` | List all identity names stored in the PIB. |
  | `delete <name>` | Remove a key and its certificate from the PIB. |
  | `anchor add <name>` | Promote an existing cert to trust anchor. |
  | `anchor remove <name>` | Remove a trust anchor. |
  | `anchor list` | List all trust anchor names. |

#### `ndn-router` — PIB loading at startup

- `load_security(cfg)` — reads `[security].identity` and `[security].pib_path`
  from the loaded `ForwarderConfig`, opens the PIB, and calls
  `SecurityManager::from_pib()`. Failures are non-fatal (warning logged, router
  starts without a security identity).

#### `ndn-router` — `iceoryx2-mgmt` optional feature

- New Cargo feature **`iceoryx2-mgmt`** replaces the Unix-socket management
  transport with an iceoryx2 shared-memory RPC channel. Works on Linux, macOS,
  and Windows without requiring a Unix socket.

  Enable with: `cargo build -p ndn-router --features iceoryx2-mgmt`

- **`MgmtReq` / `MgmtResp`** — `#[repr(C)] #[derive(ZeroCopySend)]` wire types
  with a `data: [u8; 4096]` null-padded JSON payload. Zero heap allocation; data
  lands directly in the iceoryx2 shared-memory slot.

- **`mgmt_ipc::run_blocking(service_name, engine, cancel)`** — blocking iceoryx2
  server loop intended for `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`. Uses
  `node.wait(CYCLE_TIME)` (5 ms tick) to stay responsive to both iceoryx2
  `TerminationRequest` signals and the Tokio `CancellationToken`.

- Transport selection is compile-time:
  1. `iceoryx2-mgmt` feature → iceoryx2 shared-memory RPC (all platforms)
  2. Unix target without `iceoryx2-mgmt` → Unix socket (existing behaviour)
  3. Non-Unix without `iceoryx2-mgmt` → management unavailable (warning logged)

- Added `iceoryx2 = "0.8.1"` to workspace dependencies.

### Fixed

- **`data.rs` / `signature.rs`** — removed erroneous `core::sync::OnceLock`
  references (does not exist in `core`); replaced with `std::sync::OnceLock` and
  `std::sync::Arc`.
- **`ndn-face-l2`** — `pub mod neighbor` and `NeighborDiscovery` re-export
  gated behind `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` because `NeighborEntry` holds
  `MacAddr` which is only available on Linux.

### Tests added

| Crate | Module | Count |
|-------|--------|------:|
| `ndn-security` | `pib` | 16 |

Running total across all crates: **353 tests**, all passing.

---

## [0.0.2] — Layer 5 tests (89cb5e1)

### Added

- Comprehensive test suites for all layer 5 (foundation) crates.
- `ndn-tlv`: 33 tests covering `read_varu64` / `write_varu64` / `varu64_size`
  roundtrips, all four encoding widths, EOF error cases, `TlvReader` zero-copy
  slice identity, `skip_unknown` critical-bit rule, scoped sub-readers, and
  `TlvWriter` nested encoding with multi-level nesting.
- `ndn-packet`: 61 tests covering `Name` display / prefix matching / hashing,
  `Interest` lazy field decode, `Data` signed region / sig value extraction,
  `MetaInfo` content types / freshness, `SignatureInfo` key locator, and `Nack`
  reason codes.

### Fixed

- `Data::sig_value()` returned the full SignatureValue TLV (type + length +
  value bytes) instead of only the value bytes. Now strips the TLV header using
  `TlvReader::read_tlv` before returning.
- `Nack::decode` passed raw value bytes to `Interest::decode` which expects a
  complete outer INTEREST TLV. Now reconstructs the full wire format via
  `TlvWriter::write_tlv(INTEREST, &v)`.
- Added `#[derive(Debug)]` to `Interest`, `Data`, and `Nack` (required by
  `Result::unwrap_err()` in tests).

---

## [0.0.1] — Initial workspace (1e85c1f / d4e89f1 / 19d6d48)

### Added

- Cargo workspace with `resolver = "2"` and 17 library crates + 3 binary crates
  across 6 dependency layers.
- `ndn-tlv`: `read_varu64`, `write_varu64`, `varu64_size`, `TlvReader`
  (zero-copy `Bytes`-backed), `TlvWriter` (nested encoding with 5-byte length
  placeholder), `TlvError`.
- `ndn-packet`: `Name`, `NameComponent`, `Interest` (lazy `OnceLock` fields),
  `Data` (signed region offsets, lazy content / meta / sig fields), `MetaInfo`,
  `SignatureInfo`, `Nack`, `PacketError`, TLV type constants.
- `ndn-store`: `NameTrie` (per-node `RwLock` LPM), `Pit` / `PitEntry` /
  `PitToken` / `InRecord` / `OutRecord`, `ContentStore` trait, `NullCs`, `LruCs`
  (byte-bounded, MustBeFresh).
- `ndn-transport`: `Face` trait, `FaceId`, `FaceKind`, `FaceError`, `FaceTable`
  (DashMap + `ErasedFace` blanket impl), `RawPacket`.
- Stub `lib.rs` files for all upper-layer crates.
- Design documentation split from `design-session.md` into 12 structured
  reference documents under `docs/`.
- `README.md` project landing page.
- `CLAUDE.md` guidance file for Claude Code.
