# Architecture

NDN-RS models Named Data Networking as **composable async pipelines with trait-based polymorphism** — not class hierarchies. The engine is a library, not a daemon.

## Crate Map

Crates are organised into subdirectories that mirror the dependency layers.
Dependencies flow strictly downward; no layer may import from a layer above it.

## Key Abstractions

| Trait / Type | Crate | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `Face` | ndn-transport | Async send/recv over any transport |
| `PipelineStage` | ndn-engine | Single processing step; returns `Action` |
| `Strategy` | ndn-strategy | Forwarding decision per Interest |
| `ContentStore` | ndn-store | Pluggable cache backend |
| `KeyChain` | ndn-security | Identity, signing, and trust anchors |
| `Signer` / `Verifier` | ndn-security | Cryptographic operations |
| `DiscoveryProtocol` | ndn-discovery | Neighbor/service discovery |
| `RoutingProtocol` | ndn-routing | RIB population from routing algorithms |
| `ForwarderClient` | ndn-ipc | App-to-forwarder IPC (async or blocking) |
| `ComputeHandler` | ndn-compute | Named function execution |

## Pipeline Flow

```
Interest: FaceCheck → TlvDecode → CsLookup → PitCheck → Strategy → Dispatch
Data:     FaceCheck → TlvDecode → PitMatch  → Strategy → CsInsert → Dispatch
```

`PacketContext` passes **by value** — ownership transfer makes short-circuits compiler-enforced. Each stage returns `Action`: `Continue`, `Send`, `Satisfy`, `Drop`, or `Nack`.

## Core Data Structures

- **FIB** — `NameTrie` with per-node `RwLock`; concurrent longest-prefix match
- **PIT** — `DashMap<PitToken, PitEntry>`; sharded, no global lock on hot path
- **Content Store** — trait-based; `LruCs` (in-memory), `ShardedCs` (parallel), `FjallCs` (disk)
- **Strategy Table** — name trie mapping prefixes to `Arc<dyn Strategy>`

## Task Topology

```
face_task (one per Face)
   │  RawPacket { bytes, face_id, arrival }
   ▼
pipeline_runner → per-packet processing inline
                  stages → dispatch → face_table.get(id).send(bytes)

expiry_task → drains expired PIT entries (1 ms tick)
```
