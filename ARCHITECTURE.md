# Architecture

NDN-RS models Named Data Networking as **composable async pipelines with trait-based polymorphism** — not class hierarchies. The engine is a library, not a daemon.

## Crate Map

```
Layer 0 — Binaries
  ndn-router          Standalone forwarder with TOML config and management socket
  ndn-tools           ndn-peek, ndn-put, ndn-ping, ndn-traffic, ndn-iperf
  ndn-bench           Throughput and latency benchmarking

Layer 1 — Engine & Application
  ndn-engine          ForwarderEngine, EngineBuilder, pipeline wiring, task topology
  ndn-app             Application API: express(), produce(), subscribe()
  ndn-ipc             IPC client/server, chunked transfer, service registry
  ndn-config          TOML config parsing, NFD management protocol
  ndn-discovery       Pluggable neighbor (SWIM) and service discovery
  ndn-routing         Pluggable routing protocols: StaticProtocol, DvrProtocol (DVR)

Layer 2 — Pipeline, Strategy, Security
  ndn-pipeline        PipelineStage trait, PacketContext, Action enum
  ndn-strategy        BestRoute, Multicast, ASF, composed strategies
  ndn-security        Signer/Verifier, TrustSchema, Validator, SafeData

Layer 3 — Face Implementations
  ndn-face-net        UdpFace, TcpFace, MulticastUdpFace, WebSocketFace
  ndn-face-local      AppFace, UnixFace, ShmFace (optional)
  ndn-face-serial     SerialFace (COBS framing)
  ndn-face-l2         NamedEtherFace (AF_PACKET/PF_NDRV/Npcap), WfbFace, BluetoothFace

Layer 4 — Foundation
  ndn-transport       Face trait, FaceId, FaceTable, StreamFace, TlvCodec
  ndn-store           NameTrie, Fib, Pit, ContentStore (LruCs/ShardedCs/FjallCs)
  ndn-packet          Name, Interest, Data, Nack — lazy decode, no_std
  ndn-tlv             TlvReader, TlvWriter, varu64 — no_std

Simulation
  ndn-sim             SimFace, SimLink, topology builder, event tracer

Research Extensions
  ndn-research        FlowObserverStage, FlowTable, ChannelManager (nl80211)
  ndn-compute         ComputeFace, ComputeRegistry for named function execution
  ndn-sync            SVS, PSync dataset synchronisation
  ndn-strategy-wasm   Hot-loadable WASM forwarding strategies

Embedded
  ndn-embedded        Minimal no_std forwarder for bare-metal targets
```

Dependencies flow strictly downward. `ndn-tlv` and `ndn-packet` compile `no_std` for embedded.

## Key Abstractions

| Trait / Type | Crate | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `Face` | ndn-transport | Async send/recv over any transport |
| `PipelineStage` | ndn-pipeline | Single processing step; returns `Action` |
| `Strategy` | ndn-strategy | Forwarding decision per Interest |
| `ContentStore` | ndn-store | Pluggable cache backend |
| `Signer` / `Verifier` | ndn-security | Cryptographic operations |
| `DiscoveryProtocol` | ndn-discovery | Neighbor/service discovery |
| `RoutingProtocol` | ndn-routing | RIB population from routing algorithms |
| `ComputeHandler` | ndn-compute | Named function execution |

## Pipeline Flow

```
Interest: FaceCheck → TlvDecode → CsLookup → PitCheck → Strategy → Dispatch
Data:     FaceCheck → TlvDecode → PitMatch  → Strategy → CsInsert → Dispatch
```

`PacketContext` passes **by value** — ownership transfer makes short-circuits compiler-enforced. Each stage returns `Action`: `Continue`, `Send`, `Satisfy`, `Drop`, or `Nack`.

## Core Data Structures

- **FIB** — `NameTrie` with per-node `RwLock`; concurrent longest-prefix match
- **PIT** — `DashMap<PitToken, PitEntry>`; sharded, no global lock on hot path
- **Content Store** — trait-based; `LruCs` (in-memory), `ShardedCs` (parallel), `FjallCs` (disk)
- **Strategy Table** — name trie mapping prefixes to `Arc<dyn Strategy>`

## Task Topology

```
face_task (one per Face)
   │  RawPacket { bytes, face_id, arrival }
   ▼
pipeline_runner → per-packet processing inline
                  stages → dispatch → face_table.get(id).send(bytes)

expiry_task → drains expired PIT entries (1 ms tick)
```
