//! # ndn-discovery — Pluggable neighbor and service discovery
//!
//! Provides the [`DiscoveryProtocol`] and [`DiscoveryContext`] traits that
//! decouple discovery logic from the engine core, along with supporting types
//! and the [`NoDiscovery`] null object for routers that do not need automatic
//! neighbor finding.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The engine owns a single `Arc<dyn DiscoveryProtocol>` field.  Protocols
//! observe face lifecycle events and inbound packets via hooks; they mutate
//! engine state (faces, FIB, neighbor table) exclusively through the narrow
//! [`DiscoveryContext`] interface.
//!
//! Multiple protocols can run simultaneously via [`CompositeDiscovery`], which
//! validates that their claimed name prefixes do not overlap at construction
//! time and routes inbound packets by prefix match.
//!
//! ## Crate layout
//!
//! | Module | Contents |
//! |--------|----------|
//! | [`protocol`] | `DiscoveryProtocol` trait, `ProtocolId` |
//! | [`context`]  | `DiscoveryContext`, `NeighborTableView` traits |
//! | [`neighbor`] | `NeighborTable`, `NeighborEntry`, `NeighborState`, `NeighborUpdate` |
//! | [`mac_addr`] | `MacAddr` — link-layer address shared between discovery and face layer |
//! | [`no_discovery`] | `NoDiscovery` — no-op protocol for standalone deployments |
//! | [`composite`] | `CompositeDiscovery` — runs multiple protocols simultaneously |
//! | [`backoff`] | `BackoffConfig`, `BackoffState` — exponential backoff with jitter |
