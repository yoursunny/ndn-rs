//! `DiscoveryContext` — narrow engine interface exposed to discovery protocols.
//!
//! Protocols call context methods to add/remove faces, install FIB routes, and
//! update the neighbor table.  They cannot access the engine directly, which
//! keeps the protocol implementations portable and testable in isolation.
