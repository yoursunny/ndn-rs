/// ```rust,ignore

/// protocol registered are flushed from the RIB; the FIB is recomputed for
/// affected prefixes from any remaining protocols' routes.
///
/// # Multiple protocols
///
/// Running two protocols simultaneously is the normal case: for example, DVR
/// (origin 128) discovering routes for `/ndn/edu/…` and autoconf (origin 66)
/// advertising link-local routes. Both write to the RIB under their origin;
/// the RIB selects the lowest-cost nexthop per face when building FIB entries.
