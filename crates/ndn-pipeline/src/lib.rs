//! # ndn-pipeline -- Packet processing pipeline stages
//!
//! Defines the fixed-stage pipeline through which every NDN packet flows.
//! Each stage receives a [`PacketContext`] by value and returns an [`Action`]
//! that drives dispatch (`Continue`, `Send`, `Satisfy`, `Drop`, `Nack`).
//!
//! ## Key types
//!
//! - [`PipelineStage`] -- trait implemented by each processing step
//! - [`PacketContext`] -- per-packet state passed by value through the pipeline
//! - [`Action`] -- enum controlling packet fate after each stage
//! - [`DecodedPacket`] -- lazily-decoded Interest or Data
//! - `BoxedStage` -- type-erased pipeline stage (`Box<dyn PipelineStage>`)
