# Pipeline Benchmarks

ndn-rs ships a Criterion-based benchmark suite that measures individual pipeline stage costs and end-to-end forwarding latency. The benchmarks live in `crates/engine/ndn-engine/benches/pipeline.rs`.

## Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Run the full suite
cargo bench -p ndn-engine

# Run a specific benchmark group
cargo bench -p ndn-engine -- "cs/"
cargo bench -p ndn-engine -- "fib/lpm"
cargo bench -p ndn-engine -- "interest_pipeline"

# View HTML reports after a run
open target/criterion/report/index.html
```

Criterion generates HTML reports with statistical analysis, throughput charts, and comparison against previous runs in `target/criterion/`.

## Approximate Relative Cost of Pipeline Stages

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
pie title Pipeline Stage Cost Breakdown (approximate)
    "TLV Decode" : 30
    "CS Lookup (miss)" : 10
    "PIT Check" : 15
    "FIB LPM" : 20
    "Strategy" : 10
    "Dispatch" : 15
```

The chart above shows approximate relative costs for a typical Interest pipeline traversal (CS miss path). TLV decode and FIB longest-prefix match dominate because they involve parsing variable-length names and traversing trie nodes. CS lookup on a miss and strategy execution are comparatively cheap. Actual proportions depend on name length, table sizes, and cache state -- run the benchmarks to get precise numbers for your workload.

## What Is Benchmarked

### TLV Decode

**Groups:** `decode/interest`, `decode/data`

Measures the cost of `TlvDecodeStage` -- parsing raw wire bytes into a decoded `Interest` or `Data` struct and setting `ctx.name`. Tested with 4-component and 8-component names to show scaling with name length.

Throughput is reported in bytes/sec to make comparisons across packet sizes meaningful.

### Content Store Lookup

**Group:** `cs`

- **`cs/hit`**: lookup of a name that exists in the CS. Measures the fast path where a cached Data is returned and the Interest pipeline short-circuits (no PIT or strategy involved).
- **`cs/miss`**: lookup of a name not in the CS. Measures the overhead added to every Interest that proceeds past the CS stage.

Uses a 64 MiB `LruCs` with a pre-populated entry for the hit case.

### PIT Check

**Group:** `pit`

- **`pit/new_entry`**: inserting a new PIT entry for a never-seen name. Uses a fresh PIT per iteration to isolate insert cost.
- **`pit/aggregate`**: second Interest with a different nonce hitting an existing PIT entry. This is the aggregation path where the Interest is suppressed (returned as `Action::Drop`).

### FIB Longest-Prefix Match

**Group:** `fib/lpm`

Measures LPM lookup time with 10, 100, and 1000 routes in the FIB. Routes have 2-component prefixes; the lookup name has 4 components (2 matching + 2 extra). This isolates trie traversal cost from name parsing.

### PIT Match (Data Path)

**Group:** `pit_match`

- **`pit_match/hit`**: Data arriving that matches an existing PIT entry. Seeds the PIT with a matching Interest, then measures the match and entry extraction.
- **`pit_match/miss`**: Data arriving with no matching PIT entry (unsolicited Data, dropped).

### CS Insert

**Group:** `cs_insert`

- **`cs_insert/insert_replace`**: steady-state replacement of an existing CS entry (same name, new Data). Measures the cost when the CS is warm.
- **`cs_insert/insert_new`**: inserting a unique name on each iteration. Measures cold-path cost including NameTrie node creation.

### Validation Stage

**Group:** `validation_stage`

- **`validation_stage/disabled`**: passthrough when no `Validator` is configured. Measures the baseline overhead of the stage itself.
- **`validation_stage/cert_via_anchor`**: full Ed25519 signature verification using a trust anchor. Includes schema check, key lookup, and cryptographic verify.

### Full Interest Pipeline

**Groups:** `interest_pipeline`, `interest_pipeline/cs_hit`

- **`interest_pipeline/no_route`**: decode + CS miss + PIT new entry. Stops before the strategy stage to isolate pure pipeline overhead. Tested with 4 and 8 component names.
- **`interest_pipeline/cs_hit`**: decode + CS hit. Measures the fast path where a cached Data satisfies the Interest immediately.

### Full Data Pipeline

**Group:** `data_pipeline`

Decode + PIT match + CS insert. Seeds the PIT with a matching Interest, then runs the full Data path. Tested with 4 and 8 component names. Throughput is reported in bytes/sec.

### Decode Throughput

**Group:** `decode_throughput`

Batch decoding of 1000 Interests in a tight loop. Reports throughput in elements/sec rather than latency, giving a peak-rate estimate for the decode stage.

## Benchmark Design Notes

- All async benchmarks use a **current-thread Tokio runtime** with no I/O, isolating CPU cost from scheduling jitter.
- Packet wire bytes are built with realistic name lengths (4 and 8 components) and ~100 B Data content.
- The PIT is cleared between iterations where noted to ensure consistent starting state.
- Each benchmark group uses Criterion's `Throughput` annotations so reports show both latency and throughput.

## Interpreting Results

Criterion reports **median** latency by default. Look for:

- **Regression alerts**: Criterion flags changes >5% from the baseline. CI uses a 10% threshold (see [Methodology](./methodology.md)).
- **Outliers**: high outlier percentages suggest contention or GC pauses. The current-thread runtime minimizes this.
- **Throughput numbers**: useful for capacity planning. If `decode_throughput` shows 2M Interest/sec, that is the ceiling before other stages are considered.

The HTML report at `target/criterion/report/index.html` includes violin plots, PDFs, and regression analysis for each benchmark.
