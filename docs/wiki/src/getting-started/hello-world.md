# Hello World

This tutorial shows how to run a complete Interest/Data exchange using the ndn-rs library in a single Rust program. No external router is needed -- everything runs in-process via `AppFace` channel pairs.

## How it works

In NDN, communication follows a pull-based model: a **consumer** sends an Interest packet naming the data it wants, and a **producer** responds with a matching Data packet. The forwarding engine sits between them, matching Interests to Data via the PIT (Pending Interest Table) and FIB (Forwarding Information Base).

> **💡 Key insight:** No external router is needed for this example. The `AppFace` creates an in-process channel pair -- one side for the application, one side for the engine. Packets flow through the full forwarding pipeline (PIT, FIB, CS, strategy) but never touch the network. This is the same mechanism used for production in-process applications.

    E->>P: Interest /ndn/hello
    P->>E: Data /ndn/hello "hello, NDN!"
    Note over E: PIT entry satisfied<br/>Forward Data to Consumer face
    E->>C: Data /ndn/hello "hello, NDN!"
```

## Dependencies

Add these to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ndn-app        = { path = "crates/ndn-app" }
ndn-engine     = { path = "crates/ndn-engine" }
ndn-face-local = { path = "crates/ndn-face-local" }
ndn-packet     = { path = "crates/ndn-packet", features = ["std"] }
ndn-transport  = { path = "crates/ndn-transport" }
tokio          = { version = "1", features = ["rt-multi-thread", "macros"] }
```

If you are working within the ndn-rs workspace, use `workspace = true` instead of path dependencies.

## Full example

```rust
use ndn_app::{Consumer, EngineBuilder, Producer};
use ndn_engine::EngineConfig;
use ndn_face_local::AppFace;
use ndn_packet::Name;
use ndn_packet::encode::DataBuilder;
use ndn_store::FibNexthop;
use ndn_transport::FaceId;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // 1. Create in-process face pairs.
    //    Each AppFace::new() returns a face (for the engine) and a handle
    //    (for the application).  They are connected by an mpsc channel.
    let (consumer_face, consumer_handle) = AppFace::new(FaceId(1), 64);
    let (producer_face, producer_handle) = AppFace::new(FaceId(2), 64);

    // 2. Build the forwarding engine with both faces.
    let (engine, shutdown) = EngineBuilder::new(EngineConfig::default())
        .face(consumer_face)
        .face(producer_face)
        .build()
        .await?;

    // 3. Install a FIB route: Interests for /ndn/hello -> producer face.
    let prefix: Name = "/ndn/hello".parse()?;
    engine.fib().add_nexthop(&prefix, FibNexthop { face_id: 2, cost: 0 });

    // 4. Create Consumer and Producer from their handles.
    let mut consumer = Consumer::from_handle(consumer_handle);
    let mut producer = Producer::from_handle(producer_handle, prefix.clone());

    // 5. Spawn the producer in a background task.
    //    It loops, waiting for Interests and replying with Data.
    let producer_task = tokio::spawn(async move {
        producer
            .serve(|interest| {
                let name = (*interest.name).clone();
                async move {
                    let wire = DataBuilder::new(name, b"hello, NDN!").build();
                    Some(wire)
                }
            })
            .await
    });

    // 6. Consumer sends an Interest and waits for the Data reply.
    let data = consumer.fetch(prefix.clone()).await?;

    println!("Received Data: {}", data.name);
    println!("Content: {:?}", std::str::from_utf8(
        data.content().unwrap().as_ref()
    ));

    // 7. Clean shutdown: drop consumer/engine, then await the shutdown handle.
    drop(consumer);
    drop(engine);
    shutdown.shutdown().await;
    let _ = producer_task.await;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Step-by-step walkthrough

### 1. Create AppFace pairs

`AppFace::new(face_id, capacity)` creates a face for the engine side and a handle for the application side, connected by a bounded channel. The `capacity` parameter controls backpressure -- 64 is a good default.

### 2. Build the engine

`EngineBuilder` wires the PIT, FIB, content store, pipeline stages, and strategy table. Calling `.face(f)` registers a face with the engine. `.build().await` returns the running `ForwarderEngine` and a `ShutdownHandle`.

> **🔧 Implementation note:** `EngineBuilder` uses sensible defaults for everything: `LruCs` for caching, `BestRouteStrategy` at the root prefix, and the standard Interest/Data pipeline stages. You only need to configure what you want to customize. The builder pattern ensures the engine is fully wired before it starts processing packets.

```

### 3. Add a FIB route

The FIB maps name prefixes to outgoing faces. `add_nexthop(&prefix, FibNexthop { face_id, cost })` tells the engine: "forward Interests matching this prefix to this face." Cost is used when multiple nexthops exist (lower wins).

### 4. Consumer and Producer

- `Consumer::from_handle(handle)` wraps the application-side handle with methods like `fetch()` and `get()`.
- `Producer::from_handle(handle, prefix)` wraps the handle with a `serve()` loop that dispatches incoming Interests to a callback.

### 5. The exchange

When `consumer.fetch(name)` is called, it builds an Interest packet, sends it through the AppFace channel into the engine, which looks up the FIB, finds the producer face, and forwards the Interest. The producer's `serve()` callback receives it, builds a Data packet, and sends it back through the engine to the consumer.

## Connecting to an external router

If you have a running `ndn-router` instead of an embedded engine, applications connect via the router's face socket:

```rust
use ndn_app::Consumer;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Connect to the router's management socket.
    let mut consumer = Consumer::connect("/tmp/ndn-faces.sock").await?;
    let data = consumer.fetch("/ndn/hello").await?;
    println!("Got: {:?}", data.content());
    Ok(())
}
```

This uses a Unix socket (with optional SHM data plane) instead of in-process channels, but the `Consumer` API is identical.
