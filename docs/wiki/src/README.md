# ndn-rs Wiki

**ndn-rs** is a Named Data Networking (NDN) forwarder stack written in Rust. It models NDN as composable data pipelines with trait-based polymorphism, departing from the class hierarchy approach of NFD/ndn-cxx.

## What is NDN?

Named Data Networking is a network architecture where communication is driven by **named data** rather than host addresses. Consumers request data by name (Interest packets), and the network locates and returns the data (Data packets). Every Data packet is cryptographically signed by its producer, enabling in-network caching and security that travels with the data.

## Why ndn-rs?

- **Library, not daemon** -- `ForwarderEngine` embeds in any Rust application
- **Zero-copy pipeline** -- wire-format `Bytes` flow from recv to send without re-encoding
- **Compile-time safety** -- packet ownership through the pipeline prevents use-after-short-circuit; `SafeData` typestate enforces verification
- **Concurrent data structures** -- `DashMap` PIT, `RwLock`-per-node FIB trie, sharded CS
- **Pluggable everything** -- faces, strategies, CS backends, and pipeline stages via traits
- **Embedded to server** -- `no_std` TLV and packet crates run on Cortex-M; same code scales to multi-core routers
